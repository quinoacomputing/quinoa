# A) <Package>: Imperative one-line summary about 72 chars (#WXYZ)


# B) (After 2 newlines!) Explain your changes in new paragraph (wrapped to
# about 72 chars wide).


# C) Mention related issue tickets, even for other repos, e.g. <org>/<repo>#WXYZ


# Example:
#
# MyPackage: Add great new feature foo (#1234)
#
# This new foo feature is great because no one has ever done anything as
# great as this feature.  This is great because:
#
# * We are the first group to ever think of this
# * This solves a hard problem
# * Users will love this new feature
#
# This directly addresses #1234 but it also relates to #2345, #3456, and
# other_org/other_repo#4567.
