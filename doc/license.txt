Subject: RE: Need help from you again

Pen-Shu,

The license agreement with ICs, LLC, for Patent Numbers US 5,448,642,
US 5,687,255 and US 5,822,457, has been terminated effective March 31,
2009. NASA has no other licensee of these patents. It is NASA's intent
to not pay the remaining maintenance fees owing on these patents,
thereby allowing them to eventually become abandoned, and to not
enforce the patents.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Mr. Kornblueh

Per my email cited above, NASA has no interest in licensing or
maintaining US Patent No. 5448642 and therefore has no objection to
your use of its teachings and claims.  However, while NASA has
effectively abandoned this patent, any use of the subject matter is at
your own risk and NASA cannot warrant that its use will satisfy your
particular needs or that your use will not infringe on another's
intellectual property rights.

The cited CCSDS standard does not refer to any other intellectual property rights.
