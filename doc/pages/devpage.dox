  @page      devpage References for developers

This page is for Quinoa developers.

See @ref build "advanced build options".

We roughly follow the development model described
[here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model). As a
consequence, our
[master](https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa/commits/master) (stable)
branch can lag behind our
[develop](https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa/commits/develop) (bleeding
edge) branch.
