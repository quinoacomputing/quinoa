This page collects some architecture details and software design notes from the
time while RNGTest was converted from OpenMPI to Charm++ parallelism.

@section rngtest_design_requirements Requirements, features

@subsection rngtest_design_req_1 1. Works with current and future libraries of RNGs

Currently Intel's MKL's vector statistical library (VSL) RNGs, RNGSSE's RNGs,
and a couple of Random123 RNGs are interfaced. References:

- MKL: https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl,
- RNGSSE: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2011.03.022 and
  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2013.04.007,
- Random123: http://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/releases/latest/docs/index.html

@m_div{m-block m-right-m m-note}
Note that MKL and RNGSSE2 are entirely optional. If unavailable, all features
of Quinoa can be used via Random123.
@m_enddiv

All of these libraries implement a variety of different pseudo random number
generators and importantly, all support concurrent sampling from random number
streams: MKL supports both block splitting and leap frogging, RNGSSE supports
block splitting (jumping ahead and initialization of a large number of
independent streams), and Random123 RNGs are counter-based so counters can be
initialized and incremented differently on each rank/thread.

@subsection rngtest_design_req_2 2. Works with different libraries of statistical tests

  Currently TestU01's SmallCrush, Crush, and BigCrush batteries are supported and
the design allows for other libraries of statistical tests. Reference for
TestU01: http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~simardr/testu01/tu01.html

@subsection rngtest_design_req3 3. The batteries work in parallel

The user selects a number of RNGs (with optionally specifying parameters for
each, e.g., seed, sequence length, etc.) as well as a battery of statistical
tests. The tests are then run concurrently. RNGs from all RNG libraries can be
tested (and thus compared to each other) at the same time.

@subsection rngtest_design_req4 4. Generator quality and computational cost

As the tests of the battery are run, the various RNGs are timed separately,
providing a 'generator cost' ranking. The number of passed and failed tests
provide a 'generator quality' ranking (if more than one RNGs are tested).

@subsection rngtest_concurrency 5. Concurrency

An arbitrary number of RNGs can be subjected to a single battery at a time. The
tests are run concurrently using [Charm++](http://charm.cs.illinois.edu) on a
single machine or across a set of machines distributed over the network.  The
software design is fully asynchronous yielding 100% CPU utilization at all times,
independent of the time taken by the individual tests.

Concurrency via Charm++ requires serializable objects. Charm++ discourages
pointers, function pointers, references, while encourages stateless objects (or
objects with as little and simple state as possible).

@section rngtest_design_inheritance Inheritance and runtime polymorphism

While Charm++ supports migratable objects (chares) that inherit from a pure base
class to implement runtime polymorphism via reference semantics, the current
design of RNGTest does not rely on Charm++ to do this. Instead we use Sean
Parent's [concept-based polymorphism](http://sean-parent.stlab.cc/papers-and-presentations/)
which achieves polymorphism without client-side inheritance and enables value
semantics. In concept-based polymorphism inheritance in confined to the
internals of a "base" class, which, at instantiation, is initialized via a
templated constructor by a "derived"-class object. This locality enables an
easier reasoning about the code, eliminates the need for client-side
heap-allocation, client-side indirection, and in general, leads to tighter and
more readable, simpler client-code.

Battery \a rngtest::TestU01Suite is thus used polymorphically with \a
rngtest::Battery. All polymorphism (in a classical OOP sense) is confined to the
internals of class \a Battery. A client still uses \a rngtest::TestU01Suite
polymorphically as a \a rngtest::Battery.

Analogous to the relationship between classes \a rngtest::Battery and \a
rngtest::TestU01Suite, the random number generators, available from the MKL,
RNGSSSE, and Random123 libraries, are also used polymorphically with class
\a tk::RNG via concept-based polymorphism.

Analogous to the relationship between \a rngtest::Battery and \a
rngtest::TestU01Suite, individual statistical tests of TestU01 are also used
polymorphically with the "base" class \a rngtest::StatTest.

@subsection rngtest_design_configuration Test suite and test configuration

\a rngtest::TestU01Suite is configured at instantiation by selecting a TestU01
suite, one of \a rngtest::SmallCrush, \a rngtest::Crush, or \a
rngtest::BigCrush.

Since the individual statistical tests of TestU01 are very similar in structure,
but have some differences, e.g., the C library function used to create the
results struct, the number and type of parameters, etc., which require
non-trivial initialization, i.e., function pointers and variable number of test
parameters, and \a rngtest::TestU01 is a Charm++ chare, the structure \a
rngtest::TestU01 is kept minimal, simple, and generic. This is facilitated by
templating on the properties class, \a rngtest::TestU01Props, containing the
configuration for  a given test. Since there is a large number of tests in each
\a rngtest::TestU01 battery, a great amount of code can be reused by templating
\a rngtest::TestU01 which still inherits (in a concept-based polymorphism sense)
from \a rngtest::StatTest.

As discussed above, there are three different dimensions of runtime polymorphism
in RNGTest: (1) the RNGs, (2) the statistical tests, and (3) the test suites,
all exercising concept-based polymorphism.

@subsection rngtest_design_factories Instantiation using factories

In those cases where the instantiation of the object (i.e., which object to
instantiate) depends on user input (RNGs and test suites), polymorphism is
facilitated by factories. Factories are [std::map](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map)s (associative containers) that
hold function objects and enable lookup based on a key, e.g., an enum based on
user input. Function objects are essentially smart function pointers, holding
various derived-class constructors and their constructor arguments. These
function pointers and their arguments (i.e., how to invoke them) are stored by
[std::function](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function), but the object is not instantiated at the time it is registered
into the factory. The object is instantiated after a lookup (based on a key),
after which the constructor is called thereby instantiating the derived object.
For RNGs this map is \a tk::RNGFactory, for test suites it is \a
rngtest::BatteryFactory.

The factories are implemented using maps via either reference or value
semantics. Since concept-based polymorphism enables value semantics, value
semantics is used in factories whenever possible. For more information on
Boost.factory, see
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/functional/factory.

@subsection rngtest_design_without_factories Instantiation without factories

In the case when all registered objects have to be instantiated, there is no
need for a factory, and the base class pointers are initialized by instantiating
derived objects held in a [std::vector](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector). This is the case for statistical tests held
by, e.g., \a TestU01Suite.

@section rngtest_design_charm Charm++ design

Before porting to Charm++ RNGTest used OpenMP for concurrency. The last commit
before porting to Charm++ is
[bfcab8f5](https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa/commit/bfcab8f5) and the
commit where the Charm++ port is fully functional is
[c504a51b](https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa/commit/c504a51b).  Note
that during Charm++ port of rngtest target quinoa does not fully build.

The discussion below details only _some_ of the details encountered during the
Charm++ port of RNGTest. More documentation can be found in the source code
itself as well as the individual (sometimes rather lenghty) commit messages
between the two commits mentioned above.

@subsection rngtest_design_porting Preliminary considerations

The above features, facilitating polymorphism, code reuse, e.g., factories,
etc., are certainly desirable to keep in a
[Charm++](http://charm.cs.illinois.edu) port of rngtest. However, the Charm++
implementation imposes additional challenges, especially in the view of the
constrains on the global-scope wrappers (used as library-external calls). Some
of the following challenges have been identified _before_ porting to Charm++.

- Global-scope trickery, especially with the polymorphic base class RNG
  pointers, is a challenge as any global-scope object in Charm++ must be
initialized in the main chare and must be serializable so that the Charm++
runtime system can migrate them across the network. This means that the vector
of base RNG pointers should be re-creatable after migration. This may also mean
that its factory must also be in global scope and migratable. How to migrate
[std::function](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function) is a question. As it turns out Sean Parent's concept-based
polymorphism (discussed above) significantly simplifies runtime polymorphism
using Charm++: since polymorphism is kept internal to a non-chare class, e.g.,
\a rngtest::StatTest, and the client-code can use value-semantics, the "derived"
class \a rngtest::TestU01 chare does not need Charm++'s machinery facilitating
runtime polymorphism using the PUP::able framework. Though in the final design
Charm++'s runtime polymorphism is not used, a working example is in commit
[56bdcf73](https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa/commit/56bdcf73).

- Conveniently holding references to Base is hardly an option with Charm++
  objects that should be migratable. Making Base migratable is not a viable
option and seems wasteful when only a small part of the data is needed by a
class. Passing and storing only what's needed certainly seems like a more
walkable route.

- All migratable objects must have as little state as possible. This is for
  reasons of code complexity (less PUP routines to write and maintain), as well
as computational cost (less data to migrate).

- Converting each statistical test in a suite seems like the most
  straightforward to start with when porting to Charm++. However, if class \a
rngtest::TestU01 holds nontrivial state, i.e., custom classes, they all require
custom PUP routines and must also be polymorphic with base \a rngtest::StatTest.
Furthermore, once a test was finished there should be a way to pass the control
flow back to the invoking suite to evaluate the just-finished test.  Does this
require the suite be a chare object as well? (That is also polymorphic and holds
some nontrivially migratable state.) How much does Charm++ help already with
these issues? E.g., PUP routines for STL containers exist, but some are not
optimal and don't use the latest C++ standard. As described below, most of these
issues are eliminated by a careful design of classes with as little state as
possible.

@subsection rngtest_design_charm_overview Design overview

The Charm++ design of RNGTest relies on three interacting Charm++ modules:

1. __rngtest__ -- Beside global-scope data, this file describes the
mainchare \a Main and a small helper chare, \a execute, both defined in
Main/RNGTest.C.

2. __testu01suite__ -- This file describes the chare \a rngtest::TestU01Suite.

3. __testu01__ -- This file describes the chare \a rngtest::TestU01, which is
templated on the test properties, and thus lists all possible template
specializations, corresponding to the various statistical tests available in the
TestU01 library.

@subsection rngtest_design_charm_global Read-only global-scope data

__Background.__ In RNGTest both the RNGs and the statistical test suites are
provided by third-party libraries. In other words, rngtest is only a glue-code
that ties together the RNGs and the statistical tests. Note that neither
third-party libraries (neither the test suites nor the RNGs) are aware of
Charm++'s fully asynchronous nature. This constrains how the RNGs must be called
by the batteries as the RNGs must be passed, as external generators, to the
statistical test suites. Since the currently only supported set of batteries
(TestU01) are a C library, this is done through global-scope wrappers.

__Global-scope wrappers.__ The RNGs, wrapped through the base \a tk::RNG and
children \a tk::MKLRNG, \a tk::RNGSSE, \a tk::Random123, are invoked via
concept-based runtime polymorphism (discussed above). While the RNGs are
instantiated via \a tk::RNGFactory (discussed above), to be able to call any (or
all) of the instantiated RNGs at the same time (to facilitate concurrency), we
need as many wrappers as the maximum number of RNGs, e.g., 20+. In
principle, this requires 20+ global-scope almost identical wrappers so that we
can pass them into TestU01. Note that the function signature TestU01 accepts for
an external generator is the same for all RNGs.  Templating the global-scope
wrappers on an integer, however, allows to write the wrapper only once and let
the compiler generate the 20+ slightly different wrappers, differing only in
which polymorphic RNG needs to be called by TestU01.  This requires the
global-scope wrappers to rely on a global-scope vector (or map, see below) of
polymorphic RNGs and a global-scope id, as the function signature TestU01
accepts does not allow this information (which RNG I want it to call from some
list and which parallel stream I want the next number from). The current
solution thus holds a global-scope [std::map](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map) of polymorphic \a tk::RNG objects
(using value semantics) into which the global-scope wrappers index into, using
an [std::map::find](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/find) based on a C-style enum (integer) template argument.  This
works well enabling code-reuse. See RNGTest/TestU01Wrappers.h. For more
information on why some of this (and other) data is global-scope, see the
in-code documentation in Main/RNGTest.C.
