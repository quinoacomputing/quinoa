This pages discusses how to extract statistics from a @ref walker_main
simulation. See also the @ref walker_examples.

@section stats_supported Supported statistics and PDFs

Supported at this time are ordinary and central statistical moments of
arbitrary-length products and arbitrary number of 1D, 2D, and 3D probability
density functions (PDF) with sample spaces of ordinary and/or central sample
space variables.

@section stats_def Definitions and nomenclature

  - Upper-case letters denote a full random variable, e.g., `X`

  - Lower-case letters denote a fluctuation about the mean, i.e., `x=X-<X>`

  - Letters can be augmented by a field ID, i.e., `X2` is the full variable of
    the second component of the vector `X`, while `x1=X1-<X1>` is the
    fluctuation about the mean of the first component of vector `X`.

  - If the field ID is unspecified, it defaults to the first field, i.e.,
    `X = X1`, `x = x1`, etc.

  - Statistical moments of arbitrary-length products can be computed. Examples:
    - `<X>` - mean,
    - `<xx>` - variance,
    - `<xxx>` - third central moment,
    - `<xy>` - covariance of X and Y,
    - `<x1y2>` - covariance of the first component of vector `X` and the second
      component of vector `Y`

  - In general, arbitrary-length products can be estimated that make up a
    statistical moment, using any number and combinations of upper and
    lower-case letters and their field IDs `<[A-Za-z][1-9]...>`.

  - A statistical moment is ordinary if and only if all of its terms are
    ordinary. A central moment has at least one term that is central, i.e., a
    fluctuation about its mean.

    - Examples of ordinary moments: `<X>`, `<XX>`, `<XYZ>`, etc.
    - Examples of central moments: `<x1x2>`, `<Xy>`, `<XYz>`, etc.

  - Estimation of PDFs can be done using either ordinary or central sample space
    variables. Examples:
    - `p(X)` denotes the univariate PDF of the full variable
      `X`,
    - `f(x1,x2)` denotes the bivariate joint PDF of the
      fluctuations of the variables `x1` and
      `x2` about their respective means,
    - `g(X,y,Z2)` denotes the trivariate joint PDF of
      variables `X`, `y=Y-<Y>`, and
      `Z2`
