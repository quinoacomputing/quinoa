__Navier-Stokes solver for complex domains__

Inciter is a fully asynchronous distributed-memory-parallel fluid solver for
complex engineering geometries. Computational domains of arbitrary shapes are
discretized into tetrahedron elements and decomposed into small chunks assigned
to different CPUs. The number of chunks may be more than the number of CPUs
allowing _overdecomposition_. The solution along partition boundaries, that
exists on multiple processing elements, is made consistent with _asynchronous_
communication which enables overlapping parallel computation, communication,
input, and output (I/O).

Inciter is used to research asynchronous algorithms for fluid dynamics and to
experiment with coupling asynchronous to bulk-synchronous parallel code, e.g.,
Charm++ code to MPI-only libraries. We are working on a
[Navier-Stokes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations)
solver for compressible gases. The equations governing the conservation of mass,
momentum, and energy are discretized using continuous and discontinuous Galerkin
finite element methods. We are implementing solution-adaptive mesh-, and
polynomial-degree refinement to enable dynamically concentrating compute
resources to regions with interesting phenomena such as vortices or large
gradients. Combining these features we are exploring how to scale such
high-load-imbalance simulations, representative of production multiphysics
codes, to large problems on large computers using Charm++'s automatic load
balancing capabilities.
