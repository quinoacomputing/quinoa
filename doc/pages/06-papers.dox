  J. Bakosi, J.R. Ristorcelli, **[Diffusion Processes Satisfying a Conservation Law Constraint](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/603692)**, International Journal of Stochastic Analysis, vol. 2014, Article ID 603692, 9 pages, 2014.
  @m_enddiv

  This paper develops a set of constraints that enables the development of
  statistical representations of _N_ non-negative continuous fluctuating variables
  satisfying a conservation principle. A practical example is _N_ material mass
  fractions (that must always sum to unity) in a turbulent multi-material flow.
  Example model equations that satisfy such constraints are implemented in
  walker::Beta, walker::Dirichlet, and walker::GeneralizedDirichlet.

  @m_enddiv

  This paper develops a system of stochastic differential equations whose
  statistically stationary solution is the [generalized
  Dirichlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Dirichlet_distribution)
  distribution. The system is implemented in walker::GeneralizedDirichlet.

  is implemented in walker::Dirichlet.

  @m_enddiv

  This paper explores the [beta
  distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution) as a potential
  statistical representation of the fluctuating fluid density in variable-density
  turbulence and sets the stage for developing a probability density function
  model that can be useful for simulations of turbulent flows in which exactly
  computing all relevant spatial and temporal scales is not computationally
  economical. Implementations of various versions of the stochastic differential
  equation whose invariant is beta can be found in walker::Beta,
  walker::NumberFractionBeta, walker::MassFractionBeta,
  walker::MixNumberFractionBeta, and walker::MixMassFractionBeta.
