  \page      coverage Code coverage and static analysis reports

In Quinoa code correctness is verified and quantified using @ref correct
"multiple levels" of testing. Code coverage, the percentage of lines of code
tested compared to all the code, is quantified using two independent tools:
[codecov.io](https://codecov.io) and
[gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html). Here are various code
coverage analysis reports, produced by gcov, for building in Release and Debug
mode. Also listed are static analysis reports, produced by
[cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/). These coverage builds are
automatically updated whenever the
[master](https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa/tree/master) or the
[develop](https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa/tree/develop) branches are
updated. To learn more about why we have different branches, read
