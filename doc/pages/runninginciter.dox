  @page      running_inciter Running Inciter

This page is a quick-reference guide to running Inciter, the compressible flow
solver. See the @ref inciter_main "Inciter page" for more details about the
solver itself.

Inciter can be run using the executable in `<build-dir>/Main/inciter`. If a
parallel computation is desired, `inciter` should be run via Charm++ as

@code{.bash}
./charmrun +p<num-proc> Main/inciter -c <control-file> -i <exo-mesh-file> -v
@endcode

where `<num-proc>`, `<control-file>`, and `<exo-mesh-file>` are replaced by the
number of processors, the control file path, and the exodus mesh file path.
Other options and help can be accessed by passing the `--help` argument to
`inciter`. The full list can also be found @ref inciter_cmd "here".

@section control_files Control files

Quinoa uses the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) file format for control files
(tips to convert the now-obsolete `.q` control files to lua can be found
[here](https://github.com/quinoacomputing/quinoa/issues/555)).
Example control files can be found on the following pages:
- @ref inciter_example_gasimpact_4mat "Multi-material gas impact problem"
- @ref inciter_example_f16 "Steady-state transonic flow over an aircraft"

Other control file examples can be found in various directories under
`tests/regression/inciter/`.

A comprehensive list of control file keywords can be generated by the inciter
executable as `<build-dir>/Main/inciter --helpctr`. Detailed description of a
particular keyword (say `A_jwl`) can be generated by the inciter executable as
`<build-dir>/Main/inciter --helpkw A_jwl`. The full list can also be found
@ref inciter_ctr "here".

@section restarting Restart previous runs

Quinoa uses Charm++'s checkpoint-restart functionality to restart previously
interrupted calculations. To restart a previous calculation with checkpoint
files in `<checkpoint-dir>`, run

@code{.bash}
./charmrun +p<num-proc> Main/inciter -c <control-file> -i <exo-mesh-file> -v +restart <checkpoint-dir>
@endcode

@note Checkpoint frequency is controlled by @ref inciter_cmd "Command line argument" `-r`.

@note Quinoa can currently only restart using the same number of processes as the original run.

@section Post-processing

After a successful execution, Inciter will generate the following output files
in the working directory:
- field (volume) output: `out.e-s.*`
- surface output: `out-surf.*`
- diagnostic file: `diag`
- probe history files: `out.hist.*`

Volume field output files are named as `out.imesh.e-s.its.npes.ipe`.
Each index in the name signifies a specific aspect of the output file:
- `imesh`: mesh ID, used to identify specific meshes for multiple mesh (overset) computations
- `its`: mesh time stamp, used to identify the time stamp at which the moving mesh has been output
- `npes`: total number of processing elements in the computation
- `ipe`: processing element ID that has written this output file

Similarly, surface output files are named as `out-surf.iss.imesh.e-s.its.npes.ipe`
where `iss` is the sideset ID of the surface that has been output, and other
indices are the same as that of the volume mesh.

Quinoa outputs surface and volume field files in the
[ExodusII format](https://github.com/gsjaardema/seacas). Volume field files can
be generated by including the following block in the control file:

@code{.lua}
  field_output = {
    time_interval = 1e-4,
    -- element field output
    elemvar = {
      "density",
      "pressure",
      "specific_total_energy",
      "x-velocity",
      "y-velocity",
      "z-velocity"
    },
    -- nodal field output
    nodevar = {
      "pressure"
    }
  }
@endcode

The volume field output files can directly be loaded into [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org).
Surface field files can be generated by including the following in the
control file:

@code{.lua}
  field_output = {
    sideset = { 2, 3 }
  }
@endcode

This will output element and nodal fields on sidesets 2 and 3. If the surface
output is from a parallel simulation, they need to be stitched using MeshConv,
prior to visualization. Instructions for stitching can be found
@ref surf_stitch "here".
