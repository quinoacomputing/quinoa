Yeh, Pen-Shu (GSFC-5670) Subject: RE: Need help from you again

Pen-Shu,

The license agreement with ICs, LLC, for Patent Numbers US 5,448,642, US
5,687,255 and US 5,822,457, has been terminated effective March 31,

NASA has no other licensee of these patents. It is NASA's intent to not pay the
remaining maintenance fees owing on these patents, thereby allowing them to
eventually become abandoned, and to not enforce the patents.  If you have any
questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Luis Kornblueh Subject: RE: Patent 5448642

Dear Mr. Kornblueh

Per my email cited above, NASA has no interest in licensing or maintaining US
Patent No. 5448642 and therefore has no objection to your use of its teachings
and claims. However, while NASA has effectively abandoned this patent, any use
of the subject matter is at your own risk and NASA cannot warrant that its use
will satisfy your particular needs or that your use will not infringe on
another's intellectual property rights.

The cited CCSDS standard does not refer to any other intellectual property
rights.
