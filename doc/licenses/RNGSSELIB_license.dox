The CPC non-profit use licence agreement is an agreement between the author(s)
of a program distributed by the CPC Program Library and the person who acquires
it. By acquiring the program the person is agreeing to be bound by the terms of
this agreement.

1. This licence entitles the licensee (one person) and the licensee's research
group to obtain a copy of the source or executable code and to use the acquired
program for academic or non-profit use within a research group; or, it entitles
the licensee (one company, organisation or computing centre) to install the
program and allow access to the executable code to members of the licensee's
organisation for academic or non-profit use. No user or site will re-distribute
the source code or executable code to a third party in original or modified form
without the written permission of the author.

2. Publications which result from using the acquired program will reference the
