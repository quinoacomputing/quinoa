1. OVERVIEW

The Acro testing directory.

This directory describes the configuration of Acro's nightly testing.


2. TESTING SCRIPTS

TODO.


3. SETUP

Setting up acro-test for nightly builds

A. Use ssh-keygen to create a SSH key with an empty passphrase
	ssh-keygen -t rsa

B. Copy the id_rsa.pub file into your account on software.sandia.gov
   into the .ssh/authorized_keys file

C. Checkout acro-test

D. Setup a cron job to execute

	acro-test/test_daemon

   For example, if you have installed acro-test in $HOME/src, then you might
   use a crontab line like the following:

   SHELL=/bin/csh
   5 3 * * *       (cd $HOME/src/acro-test; cvs.a update; ./test_daemon) >&! $HOME/src/acro-test/cron.out


4. MISCELLANEOUS

The windows_script.bat nightly job will fail when the kerberos password
gets updated!
