Test example for the communication library.

To run the test, do the following (this example is for gcc, adapt to your platform):

a) Go to the Zoltan/Utilities directory and type 'gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH=gcc zdrive_comm'
b) cd Communication/test
c) Run ../../Obj_gcc/zdrive_comm under mpi, for example,
   mpirun -np 4 ../../Obj_gcc/zdrive_comm

The output you get should look something like this:

>> Right answer for forward communication!
>> Right answer for reverse communication!
>> Right answer for forward communication!
>> Non-blocked, variable-sized recvs not supported
