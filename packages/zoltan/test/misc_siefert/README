Tests that exercised repartition and fast_repartition with k < p and
target k < input k.  These tests came from ML.  The exposed flaws in
construction of the augmented hypergraph, caused by some vertices' not
generating repartition edges (since they were input from parts that will
not exist in the new partition).
