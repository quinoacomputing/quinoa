Zoltan Utilities 

The following utilities are represented in this directory; details of 
individual utilities can be found in README files in the appropriate 
subdirectories.  Each utility builds its own library.

A single Makefile builds all the utilities.  For directions on building
utilities, type "gmake help" in this directorry.


Configuration files for compilation and linking on various architectures
are included in the directory Config.  These configuration files are
shared by Zoltan and the utilities; thus, some fields in the configuration
files are not used by all utilities.
