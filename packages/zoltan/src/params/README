PARAMS DIRECTORY -- Routines for setting parameter values
----------------------------------------------------------------

Files compiled into Zoltan:

params_const.h      -- Prototypes for parameter functions.

assign_param_vals.c -- Contains Zoltan_Assign_Param_Vals which loops over the 
                       set of new parameters/values associated with an Zoltan 
                       structure and sets those which are appropriate.

bind_param.c        -- Routine to bind a parameter name to a variable.
                       This function must be called before 
                       Zoltan_Assign_Param_Vals.

check_param.c       -- Routine Zoltan_Check_Param compares a string against a 
                       list of valid parameter names & checks the type for 
                       correctness.

free_params.c       -- Frees all the parameters allocated for an Zoltan struct.

key_params.c        -- Set parameter values for variables in Zoltan struct.

print_params.c      -- Debugging routine to print out the parameter settings.

set_param.c         -- Routine Zoltan_Set_Param calls domain-specific routines
		       to identify a parameter being set & usually adds it to
		       list of modified parameters & values.
