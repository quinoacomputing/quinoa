Zoltan Interface Routines
Includes general Zoltan interface, callback registry, and utilities.

zz_const.h       -- Definition of Zoltan_Struct data structure; widely used
                    throughout Zoltan.  Also definitions of macros, etc.

zz_struct.c      -- Routines for creating and destroying a Zoltan struct.

zz_init.c        -- Routines for initializing Zoltan.

zz_set_fn.c      -- Routines for registering callback functions.

zz_obj_list.c    -- Contains general routine that obtains object lists through
                    either ZOLTAN_OBJ_LIST_FN or
                    ZOLTAN_FIRST_OBJ_FN/ZOLTAN_NEXT_OBJ_FN pair.  Zoltan
                    developer can call this routine instead of invoking the
                    callbacks directly.

zz_util.c        -- Contains code for non-algorithmic routines that are
                    not application-callable but are called by Zoltan.

zz_id_const.h    -- Macros for ID manipulation.
