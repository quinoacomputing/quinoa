CH DIRECTORY -- code for reading Chaco input files.
---------------------------------------------------

Note:  This code is not compiled into the Zoltan library,
but is used by the test driver (zdrive).
Most of this code was written by Hendrickson and Leland for reading
Chaco input files. 

ch_input_const.h  -- Prototypes for chaco_input_graph and chaco_input_geom.
                     External declarations of global variables.


ch_input_graph.c  -- Contains routine chaco_input_graph, which processes
                     Chaco graph input.

ch_input_geom.c   -- Contains routine chaco_input_geom, which processes
                     Chaco geometry input.

ch_input_assign.c -- Contains routines to read an initial assignment in
                     Chaco input format.

ch_input_read.c   -- Contains routines read_val, read_int, and flush_line,
                     for reading input files.

ch_dist_graph.c,  -- Code for distributing the initial Chaco graph.
ch_init_dist.c,      Several different initial distributions are available.
ch_init_dist_const.h
