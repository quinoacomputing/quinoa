topologyVis.c:
  This MPI program discovers the network topology using the MPI extensions defined
by Sandia's IAA project (add a reference here).  It assigns a part number to each
process based on where it exists within the hierarchy, so that processes on the same
"node" or "socket" (for example) have contiguous part numbers.  It lists the part number 
assigned to each MPI process, and then the parts in each group at each level in the hierarchy.

topologyVis-Glory.txt:
  The output of topologyVis on a 64 process run on Glory.

topologyTest.c:
  This MPI program does the same discovery that is done in topologyVis.c, then stores
the topology/part information in a global data structure.  The result is that all
processes know what parts are in each group at each level of the hierarchy, and all
can map a part number to a process rank and vice versa.  Redundant levels of
the hierarchy or levels at which group size is 1 are omitted.  Then a ping-pong
test is done within a group at a level in the hierarchy and between groups at a
level in the hierarchy.  Communication performance is reported.

topologyTest-Glory.txt:
  The output of topologyTest on a 64 process run on Glory.

The TLCC machine Glory at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque has the IAA
MPI version installed.  To set the modules to use this version of MPI:

module use /home/bwbarre/Software/modules
module unload mpi
module load mpi/openmpi-1.4.1-iaa_intel-11.1-f064-c064
