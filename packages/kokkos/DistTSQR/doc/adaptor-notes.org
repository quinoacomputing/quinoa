TSQR adaptor

* Tpetra::Map is immutable (post-creation)
** That means we can use pointer equality to check whether 
   two Tpetra::MultiVector objects use the same Map.
*** If they do, then we don't have to construct / replace
    DistTsqr's communicator objects.  It shouldn't be that
    much overhead to do so anyway, though.
*** Currently we only set those communicators once.  
    That may result in incorrect behavior if different multivector
    objects use different communicators.
