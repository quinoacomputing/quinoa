These files were created using the python script included with the gtest distribution.

# Fusing Google Test Source Files
# 
# Google Test's implementation consists of ~30 files (excluding its own tests). 
# Sometimes you may want them to be packaged up in two files (a .h and a .cc) instead,
# such that you can easily copy them to a new machine and start hacking there. For 
# this we provide an experimental Python script fuse_gtest_files.py in the scripts/ 
# directory (since release 1.3.0). Assuming you have Python 2.4 or above installed on
# your machine, just go to that directory and run
# 
# python fuse_gtest_files.py OUTPUT_DIR
# 
# and you should see an OUTPUT_DIR directory being created with files gtest/gtest.h 
# and gtest/gtest-all.cc in it. These files contain everything you need to use Google 
# Test. Just copy them to anywhere you want and you are ready to write tests. You can 
# use the scripts/test/Makefile file as an example on how to compile your tests against
# them.
