# Note, any path you set here will have to be set twice; once for when doxygen
# is run from this directory, and once for when doxygen is run from the
# TPLs_src/Trilinos/packages/stk/doc  directory.

# Put local appends here! Note: Please only put append-type changes
# (IE, VAR += CHANGE) in this section. All the STK products must
# use the same configuration because, when doxygen is run from stk/doc
# to assemble HTML for the entire STK, any configuration overrides
# that happened here would affect the html generation for ALL the
# STK products.
