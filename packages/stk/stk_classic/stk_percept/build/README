Build PyPercept Interface.  
-------------------------

To configure, copy the sample-Trilinos-configure-script and edit to
your needs, let's call this new file my-configure-script. Then, do
"mkdir build.dir", cd into build.dir, execute ../my-configure-script.
Next, execute make, etc. as you would for a Trilinos build.  

Docs
----

To build the docs, cd into build.dir and run ../build-pydoc.sh.  This
builds the Doxygen-based comments from the C++ code into an xml file
which is processed by a doxy2py script to create python docstrings in
Percept_dox.i which are then %include'd in PerceptMesh.i.  This script
also must perform a make and follows it with a pydoc command to build
the PerceptMesh.html doc file.

Sierra users note:
------------------

Avoid the links used in Sierra for stk.  Instead, cd into 
   <path_to_Trilnos>/Trilinos/packages/stk/stk_percept/build
to build PyPercept.
