## This file assumes a structure like that of epetra - exe's live in

## Keep in mind that file and file2-4 live in 'package_name/test'
## Also, 'package_name/test' is the current directory
## It is recommended that all directory changing be done relative to
## the current directory because scripts live in the source directory,
## but are invoked from various build directories

## List the subdirectories of 'test' containing test exe's in the foreach loop
