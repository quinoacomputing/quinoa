#  This test is enabled by --enable-coverage
#  It will only work if "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -O0" is added
#  to CFLAGS, FFLAGS and CXXFLAGS - the latter is typically done with 
#  --with-cxxflags="-DLAM_BUILDING -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -O0" 
#
#  This test counts the numbers of source code lines which are covered by 
#  nightly tests.  If the number of source code lines which are covered by
#  the nightly tests performed on this run is smaller than a set number, 
#  given in the last line of this script, this test will fail.
#
#  This name of this test is prefixed by ZZZ_ so that it will execute after
#  all the other tests.
#
#  This test should be run only with all third party libraries included - to 
#  allow as many lines as possible to be executed by the tests.
#
#  This test is not compatible with --enable-valgrind
