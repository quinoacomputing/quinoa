 * safety of timers, so that no matter how a scope is exited (whether
 * the normal way or when an exception is thrown), a timer started in
 * the scope is stopped when the scope is left.  TimeMonitor also
 * tracks each process' set of timers, and can compute global timer

  /// \brief Compute global timer statistics for all timers on the given communicator.
  ///
  /// The typical use case for \c Time and \c TimeMonitor is that all
  /// processes in a communicator create the same set of timers, and
  /// then want to report summary statistics.  This method supports
  /// that typical use case.  For each timer in the set, this method
  /// computes a list of global statistics.  "Global" means "for all
  /// processes in the communicator."  "Statistic" means the result of
  /// a reduction over the timing and call count values.  Thus, each
  /// statistic includes both a timing and a call count.  The current
  /// list of computed statistics includes the minimum and maximum
  /// timing (and the corresponding call count for each) and the
  /// arithmetic mean (timing and call count).  This list may expand
  /// in the future.
  ///
  /// Different processes may have different sets of timers.  This
  /// method gives you two options for reconciling the sets.  If setOp
  /// is Intersection, it computes the intersection (the common
  /// subset) of timers on all processes in the communicator.
  /// Otherwise, if setOp is Union, this method computes the union of
  /// timers on all processes in the communicator.  Intersection is
  /// the default, since it means that all reported timers exist on
  /// all participating processes.  For setOp=Union, timers that do
  /// not exist on some processes will be given a zero timing and call
  /// count, so that statistics make sense.
  ///
  /// Suppose there are \f$P\f$ processes in the communicator and
  /// \f$N\f$ unique timers in the global union.  This method requires
  /// \f$O(\log P)\f$ messages (\f$O(1)\f$ "reductions" and exactly 1
  /// "broadcast") and \f$O(N)\f$ per-processor storage (in the worst
  /// case) when computing either the intersection or the union of
  /// timers (the algorithm is similar in either case).  The whole
  /// algorithm takes at worst \f$O(N (\log N) (\log P))\f$ time along
  /// the critical path (i.e., on the "slowest process" in the
  /// communicator).
  ///
  /// The "MinOverProcs" and "MaxOverProcs" timings are cumulative:
  /// the reported timing is for all calls.  Along with the min resp.
  /// max timing comes the call count of the process who had the min
  /// resp. max.  (If more than one process had the min resp. max
  /// timing, then the call count on the process with the smallest
  /// rank is reported.)
  ///
  /// The "MeanOverProcs" equals the sum of the processes' cumulative
  /// timings, divided by the number of processes.  Thus, it is
  /// cumulative over all calls, and is comparable with the
  /// "MinOverProcs" and "MaxOverProcs" timings.  This differs from
  /// the "MeanOverCallCounts" (see below).  This does <i>not</i>
  /// weight the mean by call counts.
  ///
  /// The "MeanOverCallCounts" is an arithmetic mean of all timings.
  /// It is <i>not</i> cumulative.  It reports the mean timing for a
  /// single invocation over all calls on all processes, not weighting
  /// any one process more than the others.  For each timer, this is
  /// the sum of the cumulative timing over all processes, divided by
  /// the sum of the call counts over all processes for that timing.
  /// (We compute it a bit differently to help prevent overflow.)  The
  /// "MeanOverCallCounts" is <i>not</i> comparable with the min, max,
  /// or "MeanOverProcs".
  ///
  /// We report with both versions of the mean timing the mean call
  /// count over processes.  This may be fractional, which is one
  /// reason why we report call counts as \c double rather than \c
  /// int.  It has no particular connection to the mean timing.
  ///
  /// All output arguments are returned redundantly on all processes
  /// in the communicator.  That makes this method an all-reduce.
  ///
  /// \param statData [out] On output: Global timer statistics, stored
  ///   as a map with key timer name, and with value the ordered list
  ///   of statistics for that timer.  The \c statNames output has the
  ///   same order as the ordered list of statistics for each timer.
  ///   Each entry of the statistics list is a (timing, call count)
  ///   pair, the meaning of which depends on the particular statistic
  ///   (see above).
  ///
  /// \param statNames [out] On output: Each value in the statData map
  ///   is a vector.  That vector v has the same number of entries as
  ///   statNames.  statNames[k] is the name of the statistic (see
  ///   above) stored as v[k].  Always refer to statNames for the
  ///   number and names of statistics.
