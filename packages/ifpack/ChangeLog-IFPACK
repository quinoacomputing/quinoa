IFPACK -- History of visible changes
====================================

This file reports (some of) the visible changes to IFPACK.
Please submit IFPACK bugs at software.sandia.gov/buzgilla.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Jun 2006:

*) Used RefCountPtr extensively in the IC, ICT, ILU and ILUT classes.

*) Changed the hash table class for ICT and ILUT. The latter is 
   then much faster than the previous version. The new class has a
   better memory usage and it is simpler to modify and extend.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Apr 2006:

*) Added Chebyshev preconditioner with diagonal scaling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Feb 2006:

*) Added support for UseTranspose(true) in Ifpack_AdditiveSchwarz,
   Ifpack_ILUT and Ifpack_Amesos. A simple test has been added.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Oct 2005:

*) Added support for the Galeri package. Matrices are no longer created
   using Triutils' matrix gallery, but with the improved Galeri one. Also
   fixed minor bugs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Jun 2005:

*) Added Makefile.export.ifpack. Users who want to take advantage of
   IFPACK in their codes only have to import this file in the application's
   Makefile, then use the variables IFPACK_INCLUDES and IFPACK_LIBS to
   specify the location of the header files and the location and name of all
   libraries required to link with IFPACK.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
May 2005:

*) Added module IFPACK to PyTrilinos. Now the IFPACK factory, and
   most of the IFPACK classes and functions are available through python,
   for both serial and parallel computations (requires IFPACK as shared
   library)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Jan 2005 --> version 3.0

*) Added support for EpetraExt
*) Several fixes to the doxygen documentation and to the UG, added a
   README file (which contains a basic description of the examples as
   well), fixed the DoxyfileWeb.
*) Dropped SOR and SSOR from point relaxation methods, cleaned the
   parameters name.
*) AdditiveSchwarz does no longer contain filtering by sparsity or by
   value. This feature will be made available directly to the user. An
   example has been included in the examples subdirectory.
*) improved the factory class, better handling of the overlap.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dec 2004:

*) Updated to the new Epetra.
*) First cut of the UG
*) renamed all the files for incomplete factorizations.
*) Point and block relaxation methods are no longer AztecOO-complaint if
   used as pure preconditioners. This is to improve their performances
   when adopted in a multilevel setting (like ML).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nov 2004:

*) tuned IFPACK point relaxation schemes to the ML ones. Introduced a test
   case in ML to compare the effectiveness of IFPACK and ML smoothers.
*) updated the examples subdirectory
*) created new tests

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oct 2004:

*) Defined the general interface for IFPACK preconditioners, with virtual
   class Ifpack_Preconditioner.
*) introduced the factory class.
*) added incomplete factorizations, with dropping based on values. Copied the
   already existing factorizations into new files, so that they can be
   derived from Ifpack_Preconditioner.
*) first cut for the Doxygen documentation
*) Introduced an interface to Amesos for direct solutions.
*) Dropped the interface to AztecOO as a local solver, as it was too 
   difficult to avoid code crashes.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sep 2004:

*) Introduced point and block relaxation methods (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel,
   symmetric Gauss-Seidel, SOR, SSOR). These files were living within Amesos.
*) ... and much more before this time!!
