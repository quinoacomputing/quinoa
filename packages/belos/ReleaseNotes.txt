Release Notes for Trilinos Package Belos
----------------------------------------


Trilinos 10.6:
--------------

(*) Minor changes in Belos/Tpetra adaptors.

Trilinos 10.4:
--------------

(*) Replaced non-const MultiVecTraits::CloneView(MV) with explicit MultiVecTraits::CloneViewNonConst(MV).

This is a non-backwards-compatible change to Belos::MultiVecTraits, requiring changes through Belos solver, solver managers, and orthomanagers. 
The result is that it is much harder to accidentally create a non-const view when a const view is sufficient. To do so requires CloneViewNonConst() be called
explicitly, all such calls being manually invoked during this refactorization.
