Definitions:

A BlockMap is a distributed, ordered list of elements.
An Element is an ordered list of points.

Associated with each element is:

- A global ID (GID) (stored in MyGlobalElements array).
- A local ID (LID) (implied from the order defined in MyGlobalElements).
- The local point ID (PtID) of the first point in element list (stored in FirstPointInElementList).

Associated with each point is:

- A local point ID (PtID) (determined by the number of points in previous elements and the point's position in
its own element).
- A (GID, point offset) pair.
- A (LID, point offset) pair.

Note: Points do not have global IDs.
