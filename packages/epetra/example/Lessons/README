This directory contains example codes that show how to use Epetra.
Trilinos' build system will automatically build and test these codes
whenever testing examples is enabled.

Lessons for new Epetra users
============================

If you are learning how to use Epetra, please begin with the
subdirectories whose names start with "Lesson" (e.g., Lesson01-Init).
The numbers that follow "Lesson" suggest an order in which to do the
lessons, and the name that follows the number indicates the lesson's
topic.

Note to Epetra developers
=========================

How to add a new Lesson
-----------------------

1. Create a Lesson subdirectory of the appropriate name.

The numbers that follow "Lesson" suggest an order in which to do the
lessons, and the name that follows the number indicates the lesson's
topic.  You are allowed to change the numbers of other lessons in
order to put your lesson in the right place.

2. In that subdirectory, add an index.doc file.  

Imitate Lesson01-Init/index.doc.  This file uses Doxygen markup.  If
you want to add example source codes (see Step 3 below), point to them
by using the Doxygen \example command.  You may point to one or more
examples in your index.doc file.

3. Tell Epetra's Doxygen system about the new lesson.

Edit ../../doc/Doxyfile and add the path to the new Lesson's index.doc
file to the INPUT list.  Add the new Lesson's directory (containing
its code example(s)' .cpp files, that are \include-d in index.doc) to
EXAMPLE_PATH.  Use existing Lessons as models in both cases.

4. Add a link to the new Lesson to Epetra's main Doxygen page.

Edit epetra/doc/Doxygen and add a link to the new Lesson.  Use
existing Lessons as a model.

5. In the Lesson subdirectory, add example source code(s), if any.

Look at Lesson01-Init/lesson01_mpi_only_through_Epetra.cpp as an
example.  The top of the file has Doxygen markup which marks the file
as an example, and points back to the Lesson which uses the example.

6. To that subdirectory, add a CMakeLists.txt file to tell CMake how
   to build the examples.

Look at Lesson01-Init/CMakeLists.txt for an example.  This follows the
pattern of other Epetra tests.  Be sure that your test generates the
right output string to stdout so that the test passes.  You may change
this string in your CMakeLists.txt file, but the standard pass output
is "End Result: TEST PASSED".
