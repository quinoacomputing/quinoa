  /** Abstract representation of an algebraic multi-vector. This representation may
      be used with an overlapping data decomposition. The data distribution is
      defined by the fei::VectorSpace object returned by the method
      getVectorSpace().
      This representation does not require that data be accessed only on the
      'owning' processor. Data for any indices that are either shared or owned by
      the local processor may be passed to, or accessed from, the vector on the
      local processor. In most cases the underlying library-specific vector will
      have a non-overlapping data decomposition (each equation uniquely owned by
      a single processor). Overlapping data (shared by local processor but the
      equation is owned by another processor) may be assembled into this abstract
      vector locally, and will be moved into the underlying non-overlapping
      vector on the correct processor when the gatherFromOverlap() method is
      called. Conversely, if the user wants to retrieve overlapping data from
      the vector locally for an equation that resides on another processor, that
      data is not guaranteed to be available until the scatterToOverlap() method
      is called. The scatterToOverlap() method does communication necessary to
      populate shared-but-not-owned data in the fei::Vector from data in the
      underlying algebraic vector.

      From the point of view of fei::Vector, there are two types of data: owned
      and shared-but-not-owned.

      Data Input (passing user data into the vector):<br>
      When locally-owned data is input, fei::Vector relays it immediately to the
      underlying algebraic vector.
      When shared-but-not-owned data is input, fei::Vector holds it in temporary
      storage. When gatherToOverlap() is called, fei::Vector moves it to the
      owning processor and then relays it to the underlying algebraic vector. At
      that point the temporary storage is deleted.

      Data Access (retrieving data from the vector):<br>
      When locally-owned data is accessed, fei::Vector retrieves it from the
      underlying algebraic vector directly.
      In order to access shared-but-not-owned data (overlapped data), it is 
      necessary first to call the method scatterToOverlap(). This method does the
      communication necessary to re-create and populate temporary storage with
      the shared data by retrieving that data from the underlying algebraic
      vector on the owning processor and sending it to the sharing processors.
