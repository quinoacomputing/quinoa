    \brief Here we describe the ordering interface provided by Isorropia.


\section orderingIntro Fill-Reducing Ordering

Isorropia currently supports a subset of the graph (sparse matrix) ordering features in Zoltan. 
The intended main use is to produce a permutation that can be used as fill-reducing ordering for direct
solvers. Currently Zoltan relies on third-party libraries (ParMetis and PT-Scotch) for this.
