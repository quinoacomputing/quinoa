\mainpage Anasazi: A Block Eigensolvers Package

\section intro Introduction

%Anasazi is a powerful, extensible and interoperable C++ framework for
the numerical solution of large-scale eigenvalue problems. The
motivation for this framework is to provide a generic interface to a
collection of algorithms for solving large-scale eigenvalue
problems. %Anasazi's interoperability results from its understanding
of operators and vectors as opaque objects---these objects are
accessed only via elementary operations. Hence the user has the
flexibility to specify the data representation for operators and
vectors and may so leverage any existing software investment. This
mechanism is accomplished via the \ref anasazi_opvec_interfaces
"Anasazi Operator/Vector abstract interface".  Current interfaces
available include Thyra, Epetra and Tpetra. As a result, any existing
code employing Thyra, Epetra or Tpetra operators and vectors (such as
other packages in Trilinos) may also be used in conjunction with
%Anasazi.

The \ref anasazi_solver_framework "Anasazi eigensolver framework"
describes eigensolver and eigensolver managers that provide efficient,
convenient and powerful computational methods. %Anasazi's power is a
result of the distribution of functionality across different
computational entities in the framework: orthogonalization,
sorting/selection, eigenvalue iterations, restarting methodologies,
etc.  %Anasazi's extensibility comes via the abstract interfaces
describing these entities. %Anasazi currently provides a robust set of
options, and users are able to expand this set to suit specific
research and/or application needs.  The ability to interact directly
with these objects provides great flexibility in computation, while
the existence of solver managers allow convenient programming for
standard use cases.

\section solvers Current Eigensolvers

Unlike <a href="http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/">ARPACK</a>,
which provides a single eigensolver, %Anasazi provides a framework
capable of describing a wide variety of eigenproblems and algorithms
for solving them. %Anasazi can currently solve complex and real,
Hermitian and non-Hermitian, eigenvalue problems, via the following
included methods:

<ul>
<li> 
Block Krylov-Schur method, a block extension of <em>A Krylov-Schur
Algorithm for Large Eigenproblems</em>, G. W. Stewart, SIAM J. Matrix
Anal. Appl., 23, pp. 601-614 (2000).
</li>

<li> 
Block Davidson method described in <em>A Comparison of Eigensolvers
for Large-scale 3D Modal Analysis Using AMG-Preconditioned Iterative
Methods</em>, P. Arbenz, U. L. Hetmaniuk, R. B. Lehoucq,
R. S. Tuminaro, Internat. J. for Numer. Methods Engrg., 64,
pp. 204-236 (2005).
</li>

<li>
LOBPCG, a stable implementation of <em>Toward the optimal
preconditioned eigensolver: Locally optimal block preconditioned
conjugate gradient method</em>, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 23 (2001),
pp. 517-541, as described in <em>Basis selection in LOBPCG</em>,
U. L. Hetmaniuk and R. B. Lehoucq, J. Comput. Physics, 218,
pp. 324-332 (2006) <li>IRTR, an implicit version of the Riemannian
Trust-Region Eigensolver, orginally described in <em>A truncated-CG
style method for symmetric generalized eigenvalue problems</em>,
P.-A. Absil, C. G. Baker, and K. A. Gallivan, J. Computational and
Applied Mathematics, 189, pp. 274-285 (2006).
</li>

<li>
Generalized Davidson method, a non-symmetric variant of the block
Davidson solver described above. This solver is <em>experimental</em>,
but is currently in active use. It currently only supports real-valued
scalar types.
</li>

<li>
TraceMin method described in <em>A trace minimization algorithm for
the generalized eigenvalue problem</em>, A. Sameh and J. Wisniewski,
SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 19, pp. 1243-1259 (1982).  This solver is
<em>experimental</em>.
</li>

<li> 
TraceMin-Davidson method described in <em>The trace minimization
method for the symmetric generalized eigenvalue problem</em>, A. Sameh
and Z. Tong, J. Computational and Applied Mathematics, 123,
pp. 155-175 (2000).  This solver is <em>experimental</em>.
