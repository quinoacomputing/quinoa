/*! @defgroup local_sparse_mat_vec Support for custom sparse mat-vec kernels.

    Tpetra::CrsGraph and Tpetra::CrsMatrix provide support for externally changing the sparse matrix kernels used by the classes.
    This is done by providing a new sparse kernels class, according to the \ref kokkos_crs_ops "Kokkos CRS kernel API".
    The Tpetra::CrsGraph and Tpetra::CrsMatrix classes are then templated on the new sparse kernels class, which dictates not 
    only the kernel for the sparse matrix-vector product, but also any associated storage for the kernel object and the underlying
    local sparse graph and matrix objects.

    At that point, using the new kernel is as simple as templating the %Tpetra CrsMatrix and CrsGraph objects on the sparse kernel 
    class. An example of this is in the file tpetra/examples/LocalMatOps/LocalMatOpExample.cpp, included here:

    \include LocalMatOpExample.cpp
