This directory contains some Tpetra benchmarks.

blockCrsMatrixMatVec.cpp measures performance of
Tpetra::Experimental::BlockCrsMatrix::apply (sparse matrix-vector
multiply for BlockCrsMatrix, a block sparse matrix whose blocks are
small dense matrices, all with the same dimensions).

import.cpp measures performance of MPI communication operations
involving Tpetra::Vector.

localView.cpp measures performance of various ways to get the number
of entries in a row of a Tpetra::CrsMatrix.  It mainly measures
virtual method call overhead.

vector.cpp measures performance of various computational kernels
involving Tpetra::Vector.
