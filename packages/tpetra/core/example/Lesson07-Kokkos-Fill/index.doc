\brief Construct a sparse matrix in paralel using Kokkos

\section Tpetra_Lesson07_Topics Lesson topics

This lesson shows an example of how to go from a simple finite-element
discretization, to a linear system to solve, in a thread-parallel way,
using Kokkos.

\section Tpetra_Lesson07_Example Code example

This is an example code that uses Kokkos to thread-parallelize linear
system construction.

\include 05_solve.cpp
