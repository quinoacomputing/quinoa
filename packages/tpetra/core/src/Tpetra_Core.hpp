/// \brief Functions for initializing and finalizing Tpetra.
///
/// This file declares functions for initializing (setting up) and
/// finalizing (tearing down) Tpetra.  All overloads of initialize()
/// automatically initialize MPI (if Trilinos was built with MPI
/// enabled) and Kokkos, if necessary.  The finalize() function
/// finalizes MPI (by calling MPI_Finalize) and Kokkos, if necessary.

  ///   takes a default communicator, this function returns that
  ///   communicator.  Otherwise, this function returns MPI_COMM_WORLD

  ///   enabled, or a Teuchos::SerialComm instance otherwise.
