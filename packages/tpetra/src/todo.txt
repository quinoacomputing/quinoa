TPETRA

* Switch default node type to serialnode.

* Check status of host-bound GEMM (it's not parallel; this needs fixing ASAP)

* Coalesce LocalMatVec and LocalMatSolvein CrsMatrix
  + Node dependency.

* Address REPLACE mode in CrsMatrix/CrsGraph import/export

* Rewrite globalAssemble() in CrsMatrix/CrsGraph to use import/export functionality

* Determine appropriate impelementation of checkSizes() in CrsGraph/CrsMatrix

* [As needed in the future] Add Tpetra::MultiScalarOperator abstract interface.

KOKKOS

* Add re-use option for allocBuffer()

* add Kokkos-level parallelCopy() and parallelPermute() (compute kernels, not node-member memory primitives)
  - may need to address overlapping
    + detection with fall-back to serial is okay for now; identify potential special cases in Tpetra usage
  - Use these in CrsMatrix/CrsGraph/MultiVector/Vector (doImport/doExport)
