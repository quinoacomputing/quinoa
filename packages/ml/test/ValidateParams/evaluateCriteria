# 'prohibited' means the test fails if this text is found in the test ouput
# This text means ML's validator flagged a bad parameter.
"was not found in the list of valid parameters"     prohibited

# 'in-both' means that that if the text appears in either the test output
# or gold copy, but not both, then the test fails.
# Since these appear in the gold copy, they must be in the test output for
# the test to pass.
#
# Single quotes around the text mean the phrase must be at the beginning of
# the line, modulo any white space.
