Trilinos development
====================

* Added two safeguarded line searches.  One is general and works for any nox group/vector.  The second one specifically requires a new thyra rtop and thus is only valid for thyra vectors.  The safeguarded line searches allow the user to cap individual elements in the solution vector for each nonlinear solve step.  This is used for example, to limit the change in one or more of the solution variables if a large change might result in unphysical bounds.  This is implemeted as a line search because it essentially damps a solver step.

Trilinos 11.6
=============

* Added a Fixed-point Anderson Acceleration solver.  Unit tests exist for Epetra and Thyra adapters.

* Added example of user defined preconditioner with a JFNK forward operator to the thyra support.

* Removed all usage of EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator in favor of a direct inhertance from the Thyra::ModelEvaluator.  The EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator is being deprected.

* Added support for the Thyra Group to accept user defined preconditioners and Jacobian operators.

* Merged the object code for the library noxthyra into the main nox library to work around a circular dependency for the pseudo-transient solver.

* Added a pseudo-transient solver based on Thyra objects.  Still under development.
