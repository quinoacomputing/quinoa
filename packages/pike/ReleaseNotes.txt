PIKE: Physics Integration KErnels

Pike is a blackbox multiphysics coupling tool.  It provides basic
interfaces and implementations for building high level multiphysics
coupling strategies.  In particular, PIKE provides utilities for
Picard-style couplings.  For Newton-based couplings, use the NOX and
Thyra packages to build the block phsyics systems.  In the future,
interoperability tools between NOX, PIKE and PIRO will be added.
