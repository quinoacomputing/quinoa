Thanks to John Pease Moore at MIT for contributing this test.  At one
time, the test would throw on preconditioner construction (in
Solve.cpp), with the following exception message:

Ifpack2::LocalFilter does not implement getNumEntriesInGlobalRow.

This has been fixed for a while, and certainly should work in the 11.8
release.
