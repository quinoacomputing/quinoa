//! Ifpack2_Container: a pure virtual class for creating and solving local linear problems.

/*!
Class Ifpack2_Container provides the abstract interfaces for 
containers. A "container" is an object that hosts all it is necessary
to create, populate, and solve local linear problems. The local
linear problem matrix, B, is a submatrix of the local components
of a distributed matrix, A. The idea of container is to
specify the rows of A that are contained in B, then extract B from A,
and compute all it is necessary to solve a linear system in B.
Then, set starting solution (if necessary) and right-hand side for B,
and solve the linear system in B.

<P>A container should be used in the following manner:
- Create an container object, specifying the number of rows of B.
- If necessary, set parameters for the solution using
  SetParameters().
- Initialize the container by calling Initialize().
- Specify the ID of the local rows of A that are contained in B,
  using ID().
- Prepare the linear system solver using Compute().
- set LHS and/or RHS elements using LHS() and  RHS().
- Solve the linear system using ApplyInverse().
- Get the componenets of the computed solution using LHS().

The number of vectors can be set using SetNumVectors(), and it
is defaulted to 1.

<P>Containers are currently used by class Ifpack2_BlockRelaxation.

<P>Ifpack2_Container is a pure virtual class.
Two concrete implementations are provided in classes
Ifpack2_SparseContainer (that stores matrices in sparse the format
Tpetra_CrsMatrix) and Ifpack2_DenseContainer
(for relatively small matrices, as matrices are stored as
Tpetra_SerialDenseMatrix's).

\note Still to do:
- Flops count has to be tested.
