/*! \page conf_trilinos_page Configuring Trilinos for an external build of Sundance

Here we explain how to configure Trilinos for Sundance. The hard part is
knowing the appropriate arguments for <tt>configure.</tt> If you are
running on Linux, the easiest
solution is to copy one of my \ref canned_scripts that call configure.

<ul>
<li> \ref pytrilinos
<li> \ref opt_v_debug
<li> \ref canned_scripts
<li> \ref conf_packages 
</ul>

\section pytrilinos Do I need PyTrilinos?

PyTrilinos is not required by PySundance. There is probably no 
harm in building PyTrilinos, but it is not used by PySundance.

\section opt_v_debug Optimized vs Debug Configurations

Most compilers let you control the level of compile-time optimization used
and whether to produce annotations required by debuggers. Other compilation
options you might want to set control the level of warning and diagnostic
output to be produced during compile time. Such options can be passed to
the compiler by using the CXXFLAGS argument to configure.

One optional Trilinos configuration 
flag significantly impacts the behavior of Sundance:
<ul>
<LI> <tt>--enable-teuchos-abc</tt> turns on array bounds checking in Teuchos,
which will check every access to Teuchos <tt>Array</tt> objects for
bounds errors. This is nice for debugging, but results
in a <i>serious</i> slowdown of the resulting code and so should probably
be disabled in production builds.
</ul>

Typically, I find that Sundance simulators compiled with optimization
are about 3-5 times faster in matrix assembly than those compiled
with debugging and array bounds checking. 

It is possible to turn on debugging and optimization simultaneously, but
(a) compilation will be very slow and very memory-intensive, and 
(b) the resulting debugging information might be useless because optimizations
can change sometimes the effective ordering of source lines.

\section canned_scripts Canned Scripts

In the directory Sundance/trilinos-scripts there are several scripts for configuring Trilinos for Sundance on Linux using
the Gnu compilers. 
You should be able to use these as a starting point for configuring on
other platforms.

\section conf_packages Trilinos packages to enable

If you are writing your own configuration script for Trilinos,
you should always enable the following packages:

<ul>
<li> Teuchos (utilities)
<pre>
--enable-teuchos 
--enable-teuchos-extended 
--enable-teuchos-complex 
--enable-teuchos-expat
</pre>
<li> Thyra (abstract interfaces for linear algebra)
<pre>
--enable-thyra
--enable-epetra-thyra
--enable-amesos-thyra
--enable-ifpack-thyra
--enable-aztecoo-thyra
--enable-ml-thyra
</pre>
<li> Epetra (core distributed sparse linear algebra objects)
<pre>
--enable-epetra
</pre>
<li> Epetraext (various sparse matrix utilities)
<pre>
--enable-epetraext
</pre>
<li> IFPack (incomplete factorization preconditioners)
<pre>
--enable-ifpack
</pre>
<li> ML (algebraic multilevel preconditioners)
<pre>
--enable-ml
</pre>
<li> AztecOO (iterative solvers)
<pre>
--enable-aztecoo
</pre>
<li> NOX (nonlinear solvers)
<pre>
--enable-nox
</pre>
<li> Amesos (direct solvers)
<pre>
--enable-amesos 
--enable-amesos-umfpack
</pre>
</ul>
