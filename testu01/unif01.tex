\defmodule {unif01}

This module offers basic tools for defining, manipulating, and
transforming uniform random number generators to which tests are 
to be applied or which could be used for other purposes.
Each generator is implemented as a
structure of type {\tt unif01\_Gen}. 
Several predefined generators are available in the {\tt u} modules.
Each such generator must be created by the appropriate 
{\tt \ldots Create\ldots} function before being used, and should
be deleted by the corresponding {\tt \ldots Delete\ldots} function
to free the memory used by the generator when it is no longer needed.
One can create and use simultaneously any number of generators. 
These generators are usually passed to functions as pointers to
objects of type {\tt unif01\_Gen}.

One may call an external generator for testing using the functions in
this module. See Figure~\ref{prog:ex7} for an example.
One may also implement one's own generator, by creating a structure of 
type {\tt unif01\_Gen} and defining all its fields properly.
See Figure~\ref{fig:my16807} for an illustration.

Each implemented generator returns either a floating-point 
number in $[0, 1)$ (via its function {\tt GetU01}) 
or a block of 32 bits (via its function {\tt GetBits}).
Ideally, these should follow the uniform distribution $(0,1)$
and $\{0,\dots,2^{32}-1\}$, respectively.
Most of the tests in the {\tt s} modules actually call the generator
to be tested only indirectly through the use of one of the interface 
functions {\tt unif01\_StripD},
 {\tt unif01\_StripL} and  {\tt unif01\_StripB}.
These functions drop the $r$ most significant bits of each random number 
and return a number built out of the remaining bits.

Functions are also provided for adding one or many output {\em filters\/} 
to a given generator. These functions create another generator
object which implements a mechanism that automatically
transforms the output values of the original generator in a specified way.
One can also combine the outputs of several generators in different ways.
By using the output of several generators or several substreams of the
same generator in a round-robin way, one can test the quality of these as 
examples of parallel generators.
Finally, tools are provided for measuring the speed of generators
and adding their output values (for testing purposes).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\guisec{Output filters}

The following describes some filters that can be added to transform 
the output of a given generator. In each case, a new generator object is
created that will effectively apply the filter to the original generator.
One may apply more than one filter at a time on a given generator
(for example, one may apply the {\tt Double}, the  {\tt Bias}, the 
 {\tt Trunc} and the {\tt Lac} filters on top of one another). It suffices
 to create the appropriate filters as described below.  The resulting 
filtered generator(s) will call the original generator behind the scenes.
Thus the state of the original generator will evolve as usual, even
though it is not called directly.\index{filters}


The different filters applied on an original generator are not independent
but are related as the elements of a stack. When they are no longer in use, 
they must be deleted {\em in the reverse order of their creation}, 
the original generator being the last one of this group to be deleted. 
Figure~\ref{fig:prog-filter} illustrates how these facilities can be used.

\code


unif01_Gen * unif01_CreateDoubleGen (unif01_Gen *gen, int s);
\endcode
 \tab
 Given a generator {\tt gen}, this function
\index{Generator!filter!increased precision}%
 creates and returns a generator with increased precision, such that
 every call to this new generator
 corresponds to two successive calls  to the original generator.
 The method {\tt GetU01} of this doubled generator  returns
 $(U_1 +  U_2/2^s)$ mod 1, where $U_1$ and $U_2$ are the results of
 two successive calls  to the method {\tt GetU01} of {\tt gen}. 
 If the current generator has 31 bits of precision, for example,
 then one can obtain 53 bits of precision from {\tt GetU01} 
 by creating this new generator with {\tt s}  between $22$ and $31$.
% Not true anymore:
%  The function {\tt GetBits} of this new generator 
%  will return  $(X_1 +  X_2/2^s)$ mod $2^{32}$,
%  where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are the results of two successive calls to  the
%  method  {\tt GetBits} of the original {\tt gen}.
%  So it may return  more bits of precision, but never more than 32 bits.  
 \endtab
\code


unif01_Gen * unif01_CreateDoubleGen2 (unif01_Gen *gen, double h);
\endcode
 \tab A more general version of {\tt unif01\_CreateDoubleGen} where
  the method {\tt GetU01} of the double generator  returns
  $(U_1 +  h U_2)$ mod 1. Restriction: $0 < h < 1$.
 \endtab
\code


unif01_Gen * unif01_CreateLacGen (unif01_Gen *gen, int k, long I[]);
\endcode
 \tab
  Given an original generator {\tt gen}, this function 
\index{Generator!filter!lacunary indices}%
  creates and returns a generator involving lacunary indices, such that
  successive calls to this new generator
  will no longer provide successive values from the original
  generator, but rather selected values as specified by
  the table {\tt I[0..k-1]}, in a circular fashion.
  More specifically, if $u_0, u_1, u_2, \dots$ is the sequence
  produced by the original {\tt gen}, if the table {\tt I[0..k-1]}
  contains the non-negative integers $i_0, \dots i_{k-1}$ (in increasing
  order), and if we put $L = i_{k-1}+1$,
  then the output sequence of the new generator will be:
   $$ u_{i_0}, u_{i_1}, \dots, u_{i_{k-1}}, u_{L+i_0}, u_{L+i_1},
      \dots, u_{L+i_{k-1}}, u_{2L+i_0}, u_{2L+i_1}, \dots. $$
  For example, if  $k=3$ and $I = \{0, 3, 5\}$,
  the output sequence will be the numbers
   $$ u_{0}, u_{3}, u_{5}, u_{6}, u_{9}, u_{11}, u_{12}, \dots $$
  of the original generator.
  To obtain every $s$-th number produced by the original generator
  for example (a {\em decimated sequence\/}), one should take
  $k=1$ and $I = \{s-1\}$.
%  (note that taking $I = \{0, s\}$ won't work; it would return
%  $u_0, u_s, u_{s+1}, u_{2s+1}, \dots$).
 \endtab
\code


unif01_Gen * unif01_CreateLuxGen (unif01_Gen *gen, int k, int L);
\endcode
 \tab   Given an original generator {\tt gen}, this function
\index{Generator!filter!luxury}% 
  creates and returns a new generator giving the output of the
  original generator with luxury level $L$: out of every group of $L$
  random numbers, the first $k$ are kept and the next $L-k$ are skipped.
 \endtab
\code


unif01_Gen * unif01_CreateBiasGen (unif01_Gen *gen, double a, double p);
\endcode
 \tab  Given an original generator {\tt gen}, this function 
  creates and returns a new generator giving a biased output of the
  original generator.  The output is biased 
\index{Generator!filter!biased output}%
  in such a way that the density becomes
  constant with total probability $p$ over the interval $[0, a)$, and
  constant with total probability $1 - p$ over $[a, 1)$ (the two constant
  densities are different). For example, by choosing $p= 1$ and $a = 0.5$,
  all the random numbers generated by {\tt GetU01} will fall
  on the interval $[0,\; 0.5)$. This filter can be used, for example,
  to study the power of certain statistical tests.
  Restrictions: $0 < a < 1$ and $0 \le p \le 1$.
 \endtab
\code


unif01_Gen * unif01_CreateTruncGen (unif01_Gen *gen, int s);
\endcode
 \tab   Given an original generator {\tt gen}, this function
\index{Generator!filter!bit truncated}% 
  creates and returns a new generator giving the output of the
  original generator truncated to its $s$ most significant bits.
 Restriction: $s \le 32$.
\endtab
\code


unif01_Gen * unif01_CreateBitBlockGen (unif01_Gen *gen, int r, int s,
                                       int w);
\endcode
 \tab  Consider a group of $v \le 32$ successive 32-bit integers
  outputted by generator {\tt gen}. For each of these, drop the $r$ most
\index{Generator!filter!blocks of bits}% 
  significant bits and keep the $s$ following bits numbered
  $b_{i 1}, b_{i 2}, \ldots, b_{i s}$, starting with the
  most significant, for $1 \le i \le v$.
  Make with all these a $v\times s$ matrix of bits, say ${\cal B}$.
  The generator returned by this function is a filter that builds new 32-bit
   integers from $v\times w$ submatrices of ${\cal B}$. 
  The number of columns of the submatrix $w$ must be a power of 2 no larger
  than 32 and it must be $\le s$. If $w$ does not divide $s$ exactly,
  the last submatrix of ${\cal B}$ will have less than $w$ columns and
  will be disregarded.

  If the stream of bits thus obtained from {\tt gen} is
  $$
   b_{1 1}, b_{1 2}, \ldots,  b_{1 s},
   b_{2 1}, b_{2 2}, \ldots,  b_{2 s},
   \ldots,
   b_{v 1}, b_{v 2}, \ldots,  b_{v s}, \ldots
$$
   then the new integers returned by the filter will be 32-bit integers
   taken from the rearranged stream of bits so that the first new 
   number is (its most significant bit being given first)
  $$
   b_{1 1}, b_{1 2}, \ldots,  b_{1 w},
   b_{2 1}, b_{2 2}, \ldots,  b_{2 w},
   \ldots,
   b_{v 1}, b_{v 2}, \ldots,  b_{v w},
$$
  the second new  number is made of the bits (its most
  significant bit first)
  $$
   b_{1 (w+1)}, b_{1 (w+2)}, \ldots,  b_{1 (2w)},
   b_{2 (w+1)}, b_{2 (w+2)}, \ldots,  b_{2 (2w)},
   \ldots,
   b_{v (w+1)}, b_{v (w+2)}, \ldots,  b_{v (2w)},
  $$
  and so on.

  The following examples illustrates how the filter works.
  If $r$ = 0 and $w = s = 32$, then the filter has no effect,
  the new integers being the same as those outputted by  {\tt gen}.
  If $r$ = 0 and $w = s = 1$, then the filter will return integers
  made only from the most significant bit of the original integers, all 
  other bits being dropped.
  If $r$ = 0, $w = 1$ and $ s = 32$, then the filter will return integers
  made from the columns of ${\cal B}$, i.e., since the rows of ${\cal B}$
  are made of the original integers, the filter will return the columns
  of ${\cal B}$ as the new integers. 
  Restrictions: $r \ge 0$, $0 < s \le 32$ and
   $w$ in  $\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\}$.

   floating-point numerical errors. Furthermore, the result
   may be different if the addition is done without function calls
   (as in the pre-programmed version of Wichmann-Hill for example in

 The following functions allow the joining of the output of several generators
 or of different substreams of the same generator into a single stream of
 random numbers. This can be used to test for apparent correlations between the
 output of several generators or several substreams used in parallel.
 For example, one may want to choose seeds 
 that are far separated for the same generator, while making sure that 
 such seed choice is statistically valid and does not introduce unwanted 
 correlation between the substreams thus defined.

\guisec{External generators}

Although  TestU01 implements many generators both in generic and in
specific forms, it is not possible to implement all those that are in
existence because there are just too many and new ones are proposed 
regularly. The typical user would like to test his preferred generator
with as little complications as possible. The functions below allows one 
to do just that. As long as the generator is programmed in C, 
one has but to pass  the function implementing the generator to one of the
functions below and call some of the tests available in TestU01.
It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that his generator does not
violate the conditions described in the functions below. For the
call in {\tt unif01\_CreateExternGen01}, his generator must return
floating-point numbers in $[0, 1)$. For the calls in
 {\tt unif01\_CreateExternGenBitsL} and  {\tt unif01\_CreateExternGenBits},
 his generator must return an integer in the interval $[0, 2^{32} - 1]$.
If these conditions are violated, the results of the tests in TestU01 are
unpredictable. % Similarly, a generator should not be so pathological so as to
% return the same value at every call.

As an example, Figure~\ref{prog:ex7}  shows how to apply
 {\tt SmallCrush}, a small predefined battery of tests (described on page

xorshift}, whose code is shown in Figures~\ref{fig:MRG32k3a} and
 \ref{fig:xorshift}.  One must compile and link the two external
files with the main program and the TestU01 library.
The generator {\tt MRG32k3a} returns numbers in (0, 1) and was
proposed by L'Ecuyer in \cite{rLEC99b}.
The generator {\tt xorshift} returns 32-bit integers 
and was proposed by Marsaglia in \cite[page 4]{rMAR03a}.

\subsection*{Examples}

We now provide some examples of how to use the facilities of {\tt unif01}.
Figure~\ref{fig:my16807} gives an example of how to implement one's own
generator, using all the paraphernalia of TestU01. This is specially
useful when one wants to implement a generator in generic form with
one or more parameters.
 This is a simple LCG with hardcoded parameters $m=2^{31}-1$ 
and $a = 16807$.\index{Generator!user defined}
The function {\tt My16807\_U01} will advance the generator's state
by one step and return a $U(0,1)$ random number $U$ each time it is
called, whereas {\tt My16807\_Bits} will return the 32 most significant
bits in the binary representation of $U$.
The function {\tt CreateMy16807} allocates the memory for the corresponding
{\tt unif01\_Gen} structure and initializes all its fields.

Figure~\ref{fig:unif-timing} shows how to use the timing facilities.
The {\tt main} program first sets the generator {\tt gen} to an LCG
with modulus $2^{31}-1$, multiplier $a = 16807$, and initial state 12345,
implemented in floating point. 
\hrichard {Sur ma machine Linux, le
   LCG (en entiers) est 12\% plus rapide que la version LCGFloat} 
(This generator is well known, but certainly {\em not\/} to be recommended;
its period length of $2^{31}-2$ is much too small.)
The program calls {\tt unif01\_TimerSumGenWr} which generates 10 million 
random numbers in $[0, 1)$, computes their mean, and prints the CPU time 
needed to do that.
Next, the program deletes this {\tt unif01\_Gen} object and creates a 
new one, which is actually a user-defined implementation of the same LCG,
taken from the home-made module {\tt my16807} whose code is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:my16807}.
In this implementation, the parameters have been placed as constants 
directly into the code.
Ten million random numbers are generated with this alternative 
implementation, and the average and CPU time are printed.
The same procedure is repeated for two additional predefined
generators taken from modules {\tt ulec}.
% with period lengths near $2^{191}$ and near $2^{113}$, respectively. 
Figure~\ref{fig:unif-timing-res} shows the results of this program,
run on a 2106 MHz computer running Linux, and compiled with {\tt gcc -O2}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Figure~\ref{fig:prog-filter} shows how to apply filters to generators
and how to combine two or more generators by addition modulo 1 or bitwise
exclusive-or.
The program starts by creating a simple Tausworthe generator {\tt gen1}
and it generates 20 values from it.
It then deletes {\tt gen1}, creates a new copy of it with the same 
parameters and initial state, and applies a ``lacunary indices'' 
filter to create a second generator {\tt gen2}.  
The output sequence of {\tt gen2} will be 
(in terms of the original sequence numbering)
$u_3, u_7, u_9, u_{13}, u_{17}, u_{19}, u_{23}, \dots$.
Next, the program creates a generator {\tt gen3} for which each output value
is constructed from two successive output values of {\tt gen2},
generates some values from {\tt gen3} and {\tt gen2}, and deletes them.
%
\hpierre{I would like to generate and print 20 numbers from {\tt gen1}, 
    then reset {\tt gen1} to its initial state, then 
    generate and print 20 numbers from {\tt gen2}.
    But there is no public facility to reset a generator to a given state!
    To implement such facilities, we would have to make public the
    structure type that represents the state, for each type of generator.
    Presently, these types are hidden in the .c}
\hrichard{Peut-\^etre qu'il ne serait pas n\'ecessaire de rendre le type
 de l'\'etat public. Il faudrait toutefois une fonction {\tt Init} dans 
 la structure  {\tt unif01\_Gen}.}

After that, the program creates another Tausworthe generator {\tt gen2}
and a generator {\tt gen3} which is a combination of {\tt gen1} and 
{\tt gen2} by bitwise exclusive-or.  It generates a few values with
{\tt gen3} and deletes all the generators.
