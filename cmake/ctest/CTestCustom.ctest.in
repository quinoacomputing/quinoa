# These variables represent the maximum number of characters sent as test
# output for an individual test in the Test.xml file that goes to the CDash
# server. If 0, then all output is sent, regardless of size. 0 is not
# recommended, however, because the maximum xml output that CDash can easily
# parse (on a web server with default php and MySQL settings) appears to be in
# the 50 to 100 MB range.
#
# So the sum of the output from all tests sent at one time in a Test.xml file
# should strive to be under 50M. If output is larger than that, submissions
# should be broken up into smaller, multiple Test.xml files...
