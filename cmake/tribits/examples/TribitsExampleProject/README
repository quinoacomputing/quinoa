WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESS!  This TriBITS example project will get fleshed out
more in the future to be more complete.

The project TribitsExampleProject defines a TriBITS CMake project designed to
provide a simple example to demonstrate how to use the TriBITS system to
create a build/test system for any given project.

To get started building you can create a directory structure like:

    ~/TribitsExampleProject.base/
        TribitsExampleProject/   # This directory
        BUILDS/
            GCC-<X.Y.Z>/
                MPI_DEBUG/

You can then copy the configure file as:

  cd ~/TribitsExampleProject.base/BUILDS/GCC-<X.Y.Z>/BUILDS/MPI_DEBUG
  cp ../../../../../../TribitsExampleProject/sampleScripts/linux-mpi-debug.sh do-configure

You can create another directory for SERIAL_RELEASE or whatever build type you
want.

If your system is already to set up to find the MPI compiler wrappers, you con
just configure with:

  ./do-configure -DTribitsExProj_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES=ON

and then build and test with:

  make -j4 && ctest -j4

The layout of a TriBITS project is defined in the file:

  TribitsExampleProject/cmake/tribits/doc/README.PROJECTS_REPOSITORIES_PACKAGES

Otherwise, this example TriBITS project is simple enough that it should be
enough to go on.  (However, until the TribitsExampleProject is more fleshed
out, more complete examples of the usage of TriBITS can be find in the usage
of the TriBITS system by Trilinos itself.)

For now, the main source for TriBITS is developed under the Trilinos git repo
and is snapshotted into this example project periodically.  You can choose to
snapshot the TriBITS source tree as needed to update or not, it is up to you.
You may also choose not to snapshot the tribits directory and instead use
TriBITS stored in the Trilinos source tree if your project already depends on
Trilinos.
