# An example hook script for the "pre-receive" event.
#
# The "pre-receive" script is run before receive-pack has accepted a pack
# and the repository has been updated.  It is passed arguments in through
# stdin in the form
#  <oldrev> <newrev> <refname>
# For example:
#  aa453216d1b3e49e7f6f98441fa56946ddcd6a20 68f7abf4e6f922807889f52bc043ecd31b79f814 refs/heads/master
#
# If the hook exits with non-zero status, none of the refs will be updated. If 
# the hook exits with zero, updating of individual refs can still be prevented 
# by the update hook.
#

# Hooks for sierra repositories are controlled within the /git/hooks.git
# repository. Please do not modify this file unless you are within that
# repository.
