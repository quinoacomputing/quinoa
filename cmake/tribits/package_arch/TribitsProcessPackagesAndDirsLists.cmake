#
# Below, we change the value of user cache values like
# ${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_${PACKAGE_NAME},
# ${PACKAGE_NAME}_ENABLE_TESTS, and ${PACKAGE_NAME}_ENABLE_EXAMPLES by
# just setting them to regular variables that live in the top scope
# instead of putting them back in the cache.  That means that they are
# used as global variables but we don't want to disturb the cache
# since that would change the behavior for future invocations of cmake
# (which is very confusing).  Because of this, these macros must all
# be called from the top-level ${PROJECT_NAME} CMakeLists.txt file and
# macros must call macros as not to change the variable scope.
#
# I had to do it this way in order to be able to get the right behavior which
# is:
#
# 1) Override the value of these variables in all CMake processing
#
# 2) Avoid changing the user cache values because that would be confusing and
# would make it hard to change package enables/disable later without blowing
# away the cache
