#
# Function that sets up cache variables for users to specify where to
# find a TPL's headers and libraries.
#
# This function can set up a with header files and/or libraries.
#
# The input arguments to this function are:
#
#   REQUIRED_HEADERS:  List of header files that are searched for the TPL
#     using FIND_PATH(...).
#
#   MUST_FIND_ALL_HEADERS:  If set, then all of the header files listed in
#     REQUIRED_HEADERS must be found in order for TPL_${TPL_NAME}_INCLUDE_DIRS
#     to be defined.
#
#   REQUIRED_LIBS_NAMES: List of libraries that are searched for when
#     looked for the TPLs libraries with FIND_LIBRARY(...).
#
#   MUST_FIND_ALL_LIBS:  If set, then all of the library files listed in
#     REQUIRED_LIBS_NAMES must be found or the TPL is considered not
#     found!
#
#   NO_PRINT_ENABLE_SUCCESS_FAIL: If set, then the final success/fail
#     will not be printed
#
# The input cmake cache variables that this funciton uses (if defined) are:
#
#   ${TPL_NAME}_INCLUDE_DIRS:PATH: List of paths to search first for header
#      files defined in REQUIRED_HEADERS.
#
#   ${TPL_NAME}_INCLUDE_NAMES:STIRNG: List of include names to be looked for
#      instead of what is specified in REQUIRED_HEADERS.
#
#   ${TPL_NAME}_LIBRARY_DIRS:PATH: The list of directories to search first
#      for libraies defined in REQUIRED_LIBS_NAMES.
#
#   ${TPL_NAME}_LIBRARY_NAMES:STIRNG: List of library names to be looked for
#      instead of what is specified in REQUIRED_LIBS_NAMES.
#
# This function only sets global varibles as a way to return state so it can
# be called from anywhere in the call stack.  The following cache variables
# defined that are intended for the user to set and/or use:
#
#   TPL_${TPL_NAME}_INCLUDE_DIRS:  A list of common-separated full directory paths
#     that contain the TPLs headers.  If this varible is set before calling
#     this function, then no headers are searched for and this variable will
#     be assumed to have the correct list of header paths.
#
#   TPL_${TPL_NAME}_LIBRARIES:  A list of commons-seprated full library
#     names (output from FIND_LIBRARY(...)) for all of the libraries found
#     for the TPL.  IF this varible is set before calling this function,
#     no libraries are searched for and this varaible will be assumed to
#     have the correct list of libraries to link to.
