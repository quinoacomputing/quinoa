#     [WILL_FAIL]
#     )
#  
# The arguments to the function are as followes:
#
#   <execName>
#
#     The mandatory root name of the executable that will be run to define the
#     test.  The full name of the executable is assumed to be
#     ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<execName>.exe and this executable is assumed to exist
#     in the current binary directory from where this function is called from
#     a CMakeLists.txt file.  This names is the default naming of executables
#     created by the function TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(<execName> ...).
#     However, any arbitrary execuable program or script can be called by
#     setting NOEXEPREFIX and NOEXESUFFIX and you can also give <execName> as
#     an absolute path.
#
#   NOEXEPREFIX
#
#     If specified, then the prefix ${PACKAGE_NAME}_ is not assumed to be
#     appended to <execName>.
#
#   NOEXESUFFIX
#
#     If specified, then the postfix '.exe' is not assumed to be post-pended
#     to <execName>.
#
#   NAME <testName>
#
#     If specified, gives the root name of the test.  If not specified, then
#     <testName> is taked to be <execName>.  The actual test name will always
#     prefixed as ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<testName> and as added in the call to the
#     built-in CMake command ADD_TEST(...).  The main purpose of this argument
#     is to allow multiple tests to be defined for the same execurable.
#     Otherwise, you can not do this because CTest requires all test names to
#     be globally unique in a single project.
#
#   NAME_POSTFIX <testNamePostfix>
#
#     If specified, gives a postfix that will be added to the name of the
#     executable in order build the name of the test (appended as
#     '_<NAME_POSTFIX>').  If NAME argument is given it will be selected over
#     the NAME_POSTFIX.
#
#   DIRECTORY <directory>
#
#     If specified, then the executable is assumed to be in the directory
#     given by relative <directory>.
# 
#   ADD_DIR_TO_NAME
#
#     If specified the directory name that the test resides in will be added into
#     the name of the test after any package name is added and before the given
#     name of the test. the directory will have the package's base directory
#     stripped off so only the unique part of the test directory will be used.
#     All directory seperators will be changed into underscores.
#
#   CREATE_WORKING_DIR
#
#     If specified then a single temporary working directory will be created
#     based on the full name of the test and the test will be run in that
#     directory.  This allows tests to run in parallel even if they might
#     otherwise write the same files.  NOTE: If you use this option, then you
#     will need to adjust the path to your executable or other command.  Also,
#     input file locations will need to point down a directory.
#
#   ARGS "<arg1> <arg2> ..." "<arg3> <arg4> ..." ...
#
#     If specified, then a set of arguments can be passed in quotes.  If
#     multiple groups of arguments are passed in different quoted clusters of
#     arguments than a different test will be added for each set of arguments.
#     In this way, many different tests can be added for a single executable
#     in a single call to this function.  Each of these separate tests will be
#     named ${PACKAGE_NAME}_<testName>_xy where xy = 00, 01, 02, and so on.
#
#   POSTFIX_AND_ARGS_<IDX> <postfix> <arg1> <arg2> ...
#
#     If specified, gives a sequence of sets of test postfix names and
#     arguments lists for defining different tests.  For example, a set of
#     three different tests with argument lists can be specified as:
#     
#       POSTIFX_AND_ARGS_0 postfix1 --arg1 --arg2="dummy"
#       POSTIFX_AND_ARGS_1 postfix2  --arg2="fly"
#       POSTIFX_AND_ARGS_3 postfix3  --arg2="bags"
#
#     This will create three different test cases with the postfix names
#     'postfix1', 'postfix2', and 'postfix3'.  The indexes must be consecutive
#     starting a 0 and going up to (currently) 19.  The main advantages of
#     using these arguments instead of just 'ARGS' are that you can give
#     meaningful name to each test case and you can specify multiple arguments
#     without having to quote them and you can allow long argument lists to
#     span multiple lines.
#
#   KEYWORDS <keyword1> <keyword2> ...
#
#     If specified, gives a list of keywords added to a test.  These keywords
#     can then be used to select tests to be run with 'ctest'.
#
#   COMM [serial] [mpi]
#
#     If specified, selects if the test will be added in serial and/or MPI
#     mode.  If the COMM argument is missing, the test will be added in both
#     serial and MPI builds of the code.
#
#   NUM_MPI_PROCS <numProcs>
#
#     If specified, gives the number of processes that the test will be
#     defined to run on and can also result in the test being exluded all
#     together based on comparison to MPI_EXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS.  *** ToDo: Finish
#     specification of this arugment! ***
#
#   HOST <host1> <host2> ...
#
#     If specified, gives a list of hostnames where the test will be included.
#     The current hostname is determined by the built-in CMake command
#     SITE_NAME(...).  On Linux/Unix systems, this is typically the value
#     returned by 'uname -n'.
#
#   XHOST <host1> <host2> ...
#
#     If specified, gives a list of hostnames where the test will *not* be
#     included.  This check is performed after the check for the hostnames in
#     the 'HOST' list if it should exist.  Therefore, this list exclusion list
#     overrides the 'HOST' inclusion list.
#
#   CATEGORIES <category1> <category2> ...
#
#     If specified, gives the specific categories of the test.  Valid test
#     categories include BASIC, CONTINUOUS, NIGHTLY, and PERFORMANCE.  Other
#     test categories will be added as needed.  By default, the category is
#     BASIC.  When the CATEGORIES is BASIC it will match
#     ${PROJECT_NAME}_TEST_CATEGORIES equal to CONTINUOUS and NIGHTLY.  When
#     the CATEGORIES is CONTINUOUS it will match
#     ${PROJECT_NAME}_TEST_CATEGORIES equal to CONTINUOUS and NIGHTLY.  When
#     the CATEGORIES is PERFORMANCE it will match
#     ${PROJECT_NAME}_TEST_CATEGORIES=PERFORMANCE ony.
#
#   HOSTTYPE <hosttype1> <hosttype2> ...
#
#     If specified, gives the names of the host system type (given by
#     ${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME}) to include the test.  Typical host system
#     type names include 'Linux', 'Darwain' etc.
#
#   XHOSTTYPE <name1> <name2> ...
#
#     If specified, gives the names of the host system type to *not* include
#     the test.  This check is performed after the check for the host system
#     names in the 'HOSTTYPE' list if it should exist.  Therefore, this list
#     exclusion list overrides the 'HOSTTYPE' inclusion list.
#
#   STANDARD_PASS_OUTPUT
#
#     If specified, then the standard test output "End Result: TEST PASSED" is
#     greped for to determine success.  This is needed for MPI tests on some
#     platforms since the return value is unreliable.
#
#   PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "<regex1>;<regex2>;..." 
#
#     If specified, then a test will be assumed to pass only if one of the
#     regular expressions <regex1>, <regex2> etc. match the output.
#     Otherwise, the test will fail.
#
#   FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "<regex1>;<regex2>;..."
#
#     If specified, then a test will be assumed to fail if one of the regular
#     expressions <regex1>, <regex2> etc. match the output.  Otherwise, the
#     test will pass.
#
#   WILL_FAIL
#
#     If passed in, then the pass/fail criteria will be inverted.
#
# NOTES:
#
# 1) The test can be disabled by setting the variable
# ${PACKAGE_NAME}_${TEST_NAME}_DISABLE=TRUE (perhaps in the cache).  This allows
# tests to be disable on a case-by-case basis.  Here, TEST_NAME is ${EXE_NAME}
# plus any other postfixes.  This is the name that shows up in 'ctest -N' when
# running the test.
