# TODO: Put a time limit on the command so that it will not run past the
# RUNTILL time.  You could do this by running a cmake -P driver script that
# calls EXECUTE_PROCESS(...).  There is also some python code that exists out
# there that could also implement a time limit but it is complex.


#
# Read in the command-line arguments
#

usageHelp = r"""generic-looping-demon.py [OPTIONS]

This simple program takes a command as input and runs it over and over again
(pausing in-between iterations for a given time) and then stops at the given
abolute time.

The reason that the script takes an absolute time instead of a relative time
is that this script is desiged to drive continuous itegration (CI) processes
where the CI process should shut down at some point.

NOTE: The last iteration will not start later than --run-till=RUNTILL but the
last command could run until significantly after that time.
