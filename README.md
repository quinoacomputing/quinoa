_Adaptive computational fluid dynamics_ - https://quinoacomputing.github.io

Quinoa is a set of computational tools that enables research and numerical
analysis in fluid dynamics. Using the [Charm++](http://charmplusplus.org)
runtime system, we employ _asynchronous_ (or non-blocking) parallel programming
and decompose computational problems into a large number of work units (that may
be more than the available number of processors) enabling _arbitrary
overlap_ of parallel computation, communication, input, and output. Then the
runtime system _dynamically_ and _automatically_ homogenizes computational load
across the simulation distributed across many computers.

Our ultimate goal is to simulate large and complex engineering multiphysics
problems with a production-quality code that is extensible and maintainable,
using hardware resources efficiently, even for problems with _a priori_
unknown, heterogeneous, and dynamic load distribution.

This software has been acknowledged by the U.S. Department of Energy / National
Nuclear Security Administration for open source release, O4963.
