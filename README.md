_Adaptive computational fluid dynamics_ - https://quinoacomputing.github.io

Quinoa is a set of computational tools that enables research and numerical
analysis in fluid dynamics. Using the [Charm++](http://charmplusplus.org)
runtime system, we employ _asynchronous_ (or non-blocking) parallel programming
and decompose computational problems into a large number of work units (that may
be more than the available number of processors) enabling _arbitrary
overlap_ of parallel computation, communication, input, and output. Then the
runtime system _dynamically_ and _automatically_ homogenizes computational load
across the simulation distributed across many computers.

Our ultimate goal is to simulate large, interesting (i.e., complex and
practically useful) multiphysics problems with a production-quality code that
is extensible and maintainable, using hardware resources efficiently even for
problems with _a priori_ unknown and heterogeneous load distribution that can
also dynamically change in time. Read more at our
[documentation](https://quinoacomputing.github.io) page.
