# This example shows how to work with FECrsMatrix to set non-local elements.
#
# This example should be run with more than one processor. A diagonal matrix
# is created, and all elements are set on processor zero only. Then the
# matrix is distributed, and the local entries are modified.

# This is a standard Python construct.  Put the code to be executed in a

# function if the script has been called as an executable from the UNIX command
# line.  This also allows, for example, this file to be imported from a python
# debugger and main() called from there.
