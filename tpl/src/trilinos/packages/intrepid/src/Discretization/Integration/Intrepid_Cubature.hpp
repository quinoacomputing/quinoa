    Cubature template (rule) consists of cubature points and cubature weights.
    Intrepid provides a small collection of frequently used cubature rule templates
    for FEM reconstructions on simplices (edge, tri, tet) and the pyramid cell,
    defined in the derived classes of CubatureDirect.

    For quad, hex, and triprism cells cubature templates are tensor products of CubatureDirect
    templates. The tensor-product cubatures are defined in the derived class CubatureTensor.
