Novice users should begin with Tpetra's Lessons, which live in the
../example/ directory.

Tpetra uses the Doxygen tool to generate documentation automatically
from its annotated source code.  The best source of Doxygen-generated
documentation is the HTML online users' guide.  You may generate HTML
documentation yourself by running Doxygen in this directory:

$ doxygen Doxyfile

and then pointing your web browser to ./html/index.html (again, in this
directory).

Any question, comments or suggestions are welcome.  Please direct them
to Trilinos' e-mail lists.
