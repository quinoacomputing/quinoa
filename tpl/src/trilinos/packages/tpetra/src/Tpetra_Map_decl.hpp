  /// Map concepts
  /// ============
  ///
  /// Local and global indices
  /// ------------------------
  ///
  /// The distinction between local and global indices and types might
  /// confuse new Tpetra users.  _Global_ indices represent the
  /// elements of a distributed object (such as rows or columns of a
  /// CrsMatrix, or rows of a MultiVector) uniquely over the entire
  /// object, which may be distributed over multiple processes.
  /// _Local_ indices are local to the process that owns them.  If
  /// global index G is owned by process P, then there is a unique
  /// local index L on process P corresponding to G.  If the local
  /// index L is valid on process P, then there is a unique global
  /// index G owned by P corresponding to the pair (L, P).  However,
  /// multiple processes might own the same global index (an
  /// "overlapping Map"), so a global index G might correspond to
  /// multiple (L, P) pairs.  In summary, local indices on a process
  /// correspond to object elements owned by that process.
  ///
  /// Tpetra differs from Epetra in that local and global indices may
  /// have different types.  In Epetra, local and global indices both
  /// have type \c int.  In Tpetra, you get to pick the type of each.
  /// For example, you can use a 64-bit integer GlobalOrdinal type to
  /// solve problems with more than \f$2^{31}\f$ unknowns, but a
  /// 32-bit integer LocalOrdinal type to save bandwidth in sparse
  /// matrix-vector multiply.
  ///
  /// Contiguous or noncontiguous
  /// ---------------------------
  ///
  /// A Map is _contiguous_ when each process' list of global IDs
  /// forms an interval and is strictly increasing, and the globally
  /// minimum global ID equals the index base.  Map optimizes for the
  /// contiguous case.  In particular, noncontiguous Maps require
  /// communication in order to figure out which process owns a
  /// particular global ID (getRemoteIndexList()).
  ///
  /// Globally distributed or locally replicated
  /// ------------------------------------------
  ///
  /// "Globally distributed" means that _all_ of the following are
  /// true:
  ///
  /// 1. The map's communicator has more than one process.
  ///
  /// 2. There is at least one process in the map's communicator,
  ///    whose local number of elements does not equal the number of
  ///    global elements.  (That is, not all the elements are
  ///    replicated over all the processes.)
  ///
  /// If at least one of the above are not true, then the map is
  /// "locally replicated."  (The two are mutually exclusive.)
