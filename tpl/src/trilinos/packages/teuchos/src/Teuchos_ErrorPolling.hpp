  /** \brief ErrorPolling provides utilities for establishing agreement
   * between processors on whether an std::exception has been detected on any one
   * processor.
   *
   * The two functions must be used in a coordinated way. The simplest use
   * case is to embed a call to reportFailure() whenever an std::exception is
   * detected at the top-level try/catch block, and then to do a call to
   * pollForFailures() whenever it is desired to check for off-processor
   * errors before proceeding. The macro

    \code
    TEUCHOS_TEST_FOR_FAILURE(comm);
    \endcode  

   * calls pollForFailures() and throws an std::exception if the return value is
   * true.
   *
   * Polling is a collective operation (an MPI_Reduce) and so incurs some
   * performance overhead. It can be disabled with a call to 
   * \code
   * Teuchos::ErrorPolling::disable();
   * \endcode 
   * IMPORTANT: all processors must agree on whether collective error checking
   * is enabled or disabled. If there are inconsistent states, the reduction
   * operations in pollForFailures() will hang because some processors cannot be 
   * contacted. 
   *
   * \warning This class has been DEPRECATED, due to its dependence on
   *   the deprecated \c MPIComm interface.
