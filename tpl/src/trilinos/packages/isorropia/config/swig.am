# Dependencies.  Obtain the list of dependencies by executing ls.  This could
# be empty, so when we include the dependency files, we also include 'dummy',
# an empty file used to trick configure into making the dependency directory.

include $(DEPFILES)

# Clean target.  Put the generated dependency files in the list of files to
# be removed with a "make clean"
CLEANFILES = $(DEPDIR)/*.Pi

# Define the SWIGCOMPILE macro
SWIGCOMPILE = $(SWIG) $(SWIG_PYTHON_OPT) $(SWIG_CXXFLAGS)

# Wrapper and proxy targets
