The code for this library, libmeshinggenie-1.0.la, is in src, and the code
for the example program, MeshingGenie_3dTest, is in example.  example/main.cpp
contains a C++ example of libmeshinggenie-1.0.la use.  To build
libmeshinggenie-1.0.la and MeshingGenie_3dTest, run the configure file to
generate the Makefile, and run make.

To run MeshingGenie_3dTest type "./MeshingGenie_3dTest".  MeshingGenie_3dTest
reads in the sample input file in subdirectory examples/Box.dat  The first
line in Box.dat contains the distribution radius, the random seed (if zero
then MeshingGenie_3dTest picks it), edge collapse tolerance, number of
external points (np), number of external faces (nf), and number of internal
faces (n).  The next np lines are the x, y, and z of the external points in
order.  The next nf lines are the number of points and the indices of the
external face corners isted in ordered direction to indicate the normal (which
points to the domain exterior using the right hand rule) in each face.  The
next n lines are the number of internal face corners and the x, y, and z of
each corner in that face.

The output mesh is stored in "VCells.dat".

The random seed is fixed.  However, the pseudorandom generator may yield
different sequences for the same seed on different platforms.
