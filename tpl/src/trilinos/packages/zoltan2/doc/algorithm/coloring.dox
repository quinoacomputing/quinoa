\section coloring_functionality Coloring Functionality

Graph coloring problems currently supported:
<ul>
<li> Distance-1 vertex coloring
</ul>
The algorithm currently implemented is a greedy linear-time algorithm. 
The default option is FirstFit color choice,
but Random and LeastUsed are options to achieve better balance
in the color sizes.

Currently serial; multithreaded coloring is planned for a future release.
