# FIXME (mfh 16 Jan 2016) The test doesn't currently build when TSQR
# is enabled.  This is because the test uses a custom specialization
# of MultiVecTraits that does not provide the 'tsqr_adaptor_type'
# typedef.  For now, I'm disabling the tests when TSQR is enabled.

# FIXME (mfh 25 Aug 2014) The "smallest" tests in this directory are
# running forever without converging.  Not sure why that is.  I'll
# work with Alicia to fix them, but for now I'll disable them.  Note
# that the TraceMin tests that look for the _largest_ eigenvalues pass
# just fine, so it must be a problem with shift and invert, or with
# the Belos solver in the tests.

# FIXME (mfh 15 Sep 2014) All the tests in this file now pass, except
# for the block-diagonal preconditioned MINRES test below.  That one
# runs for quite a long time.  I will leave it disabled for now.
