All of the examples in this directory use Tpetra sparse matrices and
dense vectors.

CustomStatusTest shows how to create custom convergence critera
(StatusTest subclasses) for Anasazi's eigensolvers.

TraceMinDavidson shows how to use Anasazi's TraceMinDavidson
eigensolver.  (This algorithm implements a superset of the TraceMin
and Jacobi-Davidson eigensolvers.)
