\mainpage Belos: A Linear Solvers Package

%Belos is a powerful, extensible and interoperable C++ framework for the
numerical solution of large-scale linear systems of equations. The motivation 
for this framework is to provide a generic interface to a collection of algorithms for
solving large-scale linear problems. %Belos' interoperability results
from its understanding of operators and vectors as opaque objects---these
objects are accessed only via elementary operations. Hence the user has the
flexibility to specify the data representation for operators and vectors and
may so leverage any existing software investment. This mechanism is
accomplished via the \ref belos_opvec_interfaces "Belos Operator/Vector abstract interface".
Current interfaces available include Thyra, Epetra and Tpetra. As a result, any
existing code employing Thyra, Epetra or Tpetra operators and vectors (such as other
packages in Trilinos) may also be used in conjunction with %Belos.

The \ref belos_solver_framework "Belos linear solver framework" describes solver
managers that provide efficient, convenient, and powerful computational methods
for solving large-scale linear systems of equations. %Belos' power is a result of the
distribution of functionality across different computational entities in the
framework: orthogonalization, iterations, stopping criteria, restarting methodologies, etc.
%Belos' extensibility comes via the abstract interfaces describing these entities. 
%Belos currently provides a robust set of options, and users are able to expand this 
set to suit specific research and/or application needs.
The ability to interact directly with these objects provides great flexibility in computation, 
while the existence of solver managers allow convenient programming for standard use cases.

\section solvers Current Linear Solvers 

%Belos provides a framework capable of solving a wide variety of linear systems of equations. 
%Belos can currently solve complex and real, Hermitian and non-Hermitian, linear problems, via the following included methods:

   <ul>
   <li>Single-vector and block GMRES
   <li>Single-vector and block CG
   <li>Pseudo-block variants (perform single-vector algorithms simultaneously):  pseudo-block CG, pseudo-block GMRES
   <li>Recycling solvers:  GCRO-DR and RCG
   <li>Flexible variants:  Flexible GMRES
   </ul>

\section belos_browser Browse all of Belos as a single doxygen collection

You can browse all of Belos as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about Belos software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of belos</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.

\section belos_thyra Thyra support

The <a href="../../thyra/doc/html/index.html">Belos to Thyra Linear Solver
Adapters</a> take <tt>Thyra::LinearOpBase</tt> objects and turn them into
<tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> objects which can then be used to solve
linear systems using %Belos linear solvers implementations.
