The product numSubDir1*numSubDir2*numSubDir3 must equal the total
number of processors for the run. The product nsspp1*nsspp2*nsspp3 is
the number of smaller subdomains for each processor. nthreadOuter specifies
the number of threads used on each processor to loop over the smaller
subdomains, while nthreadInner specifies the number of threads to be used
by the direct solver. Note if a serial direct solver is used, we later
set nthreadInner = 1. Also, in order to use nested parallelism, the following
set of environment variables was suggested (see message from Mike Glass).

MKL_DYNAMIC=false
OMP_NESTED=true
OMP_PLACES=cores
OMP_PROC_BIND=close

OMP_NESTED is not set to true, then only the outer loops will be threaded.
For some builds it may be possible to set the outer and inner number of
threads with an environment variable, e.g.,

OMP_NUM_THREADS=60,4

for nthreadOuter=60 and nthreadInner=4, but this approach isn't currently
taken here.
