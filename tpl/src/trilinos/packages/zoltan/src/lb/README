LB DIRECTORY -- Zoltan load-balancing tools.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

lb_balance.c     -- Routines for computing new partitions and 
                    managing memory for allocated by Zoltan but returned
                    to the application. 

lb_eval.c        -- Routines for evaluating the quality of partitions.

lb_init.c        -- Routines to initialize Zoltan's load-balancing tools.

lb_migrate.c     -- Routines to provide help for data migration.

lb_set_method.c  -- Routines to set the load-balancing method.

lb_set_fn.c      -- Routines to register callback functions specific to 
                    load-balancing tools.

lb_const.h       -- Zoltan data structures for load balancing;
                    these data structures are private to the 
                    library (i.e., not seen by the application). 
                    Also includes macros and prototypes for Zoltan
                    load-balancing functions.
