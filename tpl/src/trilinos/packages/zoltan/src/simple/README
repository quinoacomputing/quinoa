This module (directory) contains a couple very simple partitioning
algorithms. They are instructional and mainly useful for testing,
not for real work.

random - Randomly assigns objects, without attempting load-balance.
         May also be used to introduce random perturbations.

block - A simple load-balancing method based on "block" partitioning 
        where objects are arranged in a linear order.
        Not related to 2D block matrix partitioning.
