This directory contains a crude Matlab interface to Zoltan
for partitioning sparse matrices (by rows or columns).
This is not a finished product, but work in progress that you
may find useful. This version is quite slow (inefficient) since it
is based on file input/output instead of a direct mex interface. 
You will need to build the zdrive test driver in Zoltan ('make zdrive')
before calling the zoltan Matlab function.
