KDDKDD 5/11/07:  Round-off error in the computation of v2Col
and n2Row in phg_distrib.c can lead to different answers on 
different platforms.

Vertices or edges get sent to different processors during the 
split, resulting in different matchings and, thus, different
answers.

Problem was observed on hg_cage10, zdrive.inp.phg.ipm.nproc_vertex1
and zdrive.inp.phg.ipm.nproc_edge1;
solaris machine seamus and linux machine patches give different
results due to differences in n2Row and v2Col, respectively.  

Neither answer is wrong, but the linux results result in FAILED 
tests in test_zoltan.
