%A future developer or person performing analysis of a new version of OSKI would want to start
%at the following places.
For the current (1.0.1h) version of OSKI, a developer may want to implement the solve function
and run more weak scalability or other parallel tests to determine why the composed kernels do not scale
well.
For a newer version of OSKI,
a developer may want to test any new tuning features,
the matrix power kernel, as well as any other new functions.
Finally, we recommend  any new version of OSKI be tested
on the Barcelona and Xeon chips, as we were never able to successfully install OSKI on these
architectures.
The Barcelona is of particular interest, as it is the processor found in the center section of Red Storm.
%Before the final submission of the paper we hope to have run tests on the quad-core AMD Barcelona chip,
%have parallel results for the citeseer matrix, have run a larger block matrix,
%run weak scaling tests, and a test on a cluster.
