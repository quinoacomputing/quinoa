*\Name: EPETRA_DCRSMV
*
*\Description:
*	EPETRA_DCRSMV performs one of the matrix-vector operations
*
*    y = A*x or y = A'*x.
*
*    where x, y are vectors, A is an
*    m-by-n matrix, and A' is the transpose of A.  The matrix
*    A is stored in a special one dimensional row-pointer
*    format where the zeroes in each row are discarded and
*    the non-zeroes are stored contiguously.  A corresponding
*    integer array, pntr, holds pointers indicating the start of
*    each row in A.  Each element of the array indx contains
*    the row index of the corresponding element of A.
*
*\Usage:
*     call DCRSMV( itrans, udiag, m, n, val, indx, pntr, x, y )
*
*
*
*    itrans Integer (input)
*           On entry, itrans specifies the operation to be performed.
*           If itrans = 0, z := A*x + beta*y.
*           If itrans = 1, z := A'*x + beta*y.
*           If itrans is any other value, then no operation is
*           performed.
*           The itrans argument is unchanged on exit.
*
*    udiag  Integer (input)
*           On entry, udiag specifies whether or not the matrix should
*           be assumed to have a unit diagonal.
*           If udiag = 1, add x to the result of y as though unit
*           diagonal were present.
*           If udiag is any other value, then no unit diagonal is assumed.
*           The udiag argument is unchanged on exit.
*
*    m      Integer (input)
*           On entry, m specifies the number of rows of
*           the matrix a.  m must be at least 0.  The m argument
*           is unchanged on exit.
*
*    n      Integer (input)
*           On entry, n specifies the number of columns of
*           the matrix a.  n must be at least 0.  The n argument
*           is unchanged on exit.
*
*    val    real*8 array (input)
*           On entry, val holds the values of matrix A in packed form as
*           described above.
*           The array val is unchanged on exit.
*
*    indx   Integer array (input)
*           On entry, indx holds the row indices of the non-zero
*           elements in A.  indx must have length > = nnz.
*           The array indx is unchanged on exit.
*
*    pntr   Integer array (input)
*           On entry, pntr(j) contains the offset into val and indx
*           for entries in the jth row pntr must have length > = n+1.
*           pntr is unchanged on exit.
*
*    x      real*8 array (input)
*           Real array of dimension at least n when itrans = 0
*           and at least m otherwise.  Before entry, the array x
*           must contain the vector operand x.
*           The argument x is unchanged on exit.
*
*    y      real*8 array (output)
*           Real array of dimension at least m when itrans = 0 and
*           at least n otherwise.  On exit, y contains the result
*           vector.
*
*\Remarks:
*    1.  x and y cannot be the same vector.
*        Unpredictable results will occur if x and y are the same.
*
*    2.  Although the example below stores the elements of each
*        column in natural order, this routine makes no assumption
*        about the order of the non-zeroes within a column.
*
*\Examples:
*    If the original matrix is
*
*                   | 11  12   0  14   0 |
*                   | 21  22  23   0   0 |
*                   |  0  32  33   0   0 |
*                   |  0   0   0   0  45 |
*                   | 51  52   0  54   0 |
*
*    then the matrix is assumed to be stored as
*
*    val = ( 11  12  14  21  22  23  32  33  45  51  52  54 )
*
*    with the corresponding pointer arrays
*
*   indx = (  0   1   3   0   1   2   1   2   4   0   1   3 ).
*
*                pntr = (0  3  6  8  9  12)
*
*    Thus, indx(j) indicates the column position of the jth element
*    of val and pntr(i) points to the first element of ith row.
*
