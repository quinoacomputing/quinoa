"Mini Implicit Thermal Conduction Application"
  - mini-application
  - simple linear finite elements
  - simple thermal conduction problem on a box
  - generation and solution of sparse linear system

Purpose:

To analyze performance and evaluate
usability of the Kokkos Array programming model.

History:

Kernels for MiniImplTherm were extracted from the
Mantevo miniFE mini-application.  MiniImplTherm
is not a replacement for the Mantevo miniFE.

Build Script:

The 'build.sh' script is intended to gather
build configurations for various platforms.
The list of options is intended to be extended
as platform-specific build configurations are
required.  As these configurations are identified
please add them to the options list and update
this simple build script.
