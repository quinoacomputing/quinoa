\mainpage Trilinos/Kokkos: Core Kernels Package

\section kokkos_intro Introduction

%Kokkos provides two main capabilities for Trilinos. The first is an abstract
programming interface (API) for handling memory and specifying work for
shared-memory parallel nodes (the \ref kokkos_node_api "Kokkos Node API"). The second is a collection
of local (i.e., not distributed) linear algebra classes and the kernels
needed to realized their functionality in parallel (the %Kokkos Linear Algebra kernels library). In addition to providing 
basic data structures and kernels, %Kokkos also specifies APIs for extension via user-provided kernels (see, e.g., the \ref kokkos_crs_ops "Kokkos Compressed-Row Sparse API").

%Kokkos is typically not used directly in applications, but instead as a significant
component in higher-level Trilinos packages, such as Tpetra. The functionality
contained here-in has been put in the %Kokkos package in order to facilitate
code re-use between Trilinos packages and to ease experimentation for kernel researchers.

\section kokkos_startup Overview of Kokkos.

\subsection kokkos_formulations Kokkos Classes

%Kokkos contains a number of classes.  They can be categorized as follows:

- %Kokkos Node API
  - Nodes based on the Kokkos::CUDANodeMemoryModel: GPU nodes using the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html">NVIDIA/CUDA</a> graphic processing units (GPUs)
     - Kokkos::ThrustGPUNode provides parallel compute capability for  via the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/thrust/">Thrust library</a>.
  - Nodes based on the Kokkos::StandardNodeMemoryModel: Host-bound/CPU nodes using standard memory allocation.
     - Kokkos::SerialNode: provides a simple node, where all kernels are executed in serial.
     - Kokkos::TBBNode: provides support for multi-core CPUs using <a href="http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/">Intel TBB</a> (requires third-party library TBB).
     - Kokkos::TPINode: provides support for multi-core CPUs using Pthreads, via the ThreadPool package (requires ThreadPool package and Pthreads TPL).
- %Kokkos Linear Algebra Kernels Library
  - Data structures:
    - Kokkos::CrsMatrix, Kokkos::CrsGraph classes:  Classes providing the
    storage structure for a row-oriented sparse matrix.
    - Kokkos::MultiVector class: A class providing the structure of a dense
    multivector. Here, as throughout most of Trilinos, a "multivector" refers to a
    collection of vectors.
  - Arithmetic interfaces:
    - Kokkos::DefaultArithmetic: Provides basic functionality for 
    performing arithmetic of multivectors.
    - Kokkos::DefaultHostSparseOps, Kokkos::DefaultDeviceSparseOps: Provides basic functionality for 
    computing multiplication and solve of a sparse matrix against a multivector.
  
\subsection kokkos_trilinos Building Kokkos and using it in Trilinos

Kokkos can be used as a stand-alone package. However, its primary use case is via the functionality provided to other packages, such as Tpetra,
Ifpack2 and Isorropia.

See \ref kokkos_cuda_support "Kokkos CUDA Support" for instructions on building with support for NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.
