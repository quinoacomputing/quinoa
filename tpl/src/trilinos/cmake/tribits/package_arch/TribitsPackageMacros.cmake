# The arguments are:
#
#   <packageName>
#
#     Gives the name of the Package, mostly just for checking and
#     documentation purposes.
#
#   ENABLE_SHADOWING_WARNINGS
#
#     If specified, then shadowing warnings will be turned on for supported
#     platforms/compilers.  The default is for shadowing warnings to be turned
#     off.  Note that this can be overridden globally by setting the cache
#     variable ${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_SHADOWING_WARNIGNS.
#
#   DISABLE_STRONG_WARNINGS
#
#     If specified, then all strong warnings will be turned off, if they are
#     not already turned off by global cache varaibles.
#
#   CLEANED
#
#     If specified, then warnings will be promoted to errors for all defined
#     warnings.
#
#   DISABLE_CIRCULAR_REF_DETECTION_FAILURE
#
#     If specified, then the standard grep looking for RCPNode circular
#     references that causes tests to fail will be disabled.  Note that if
#     these warnings are being produced then it means that the test is leaking
#     memory and user like may also be leaking memory.
