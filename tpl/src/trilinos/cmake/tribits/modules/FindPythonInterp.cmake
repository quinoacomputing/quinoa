# This is a modification of the standard PythonInterp module that adds
# version checking.

# - Find python interpreter
# This module finds if Python interpreter is installed and determines where the
# executables are. This code sets the following variables:
#
#  PYTHONINTERP_FOUND - Was the Python executable found
#  PYTHON_EXECUTABLE  - path to the Python interpreter
#
# This module also responds to the following CMake cache varibles:
#
#  PythonInterp_FIND_VERSION - Requires that a given version be found
#    if some Python executable is found (e.g. '2.4').  Note that this
#    results in the most recent Python version that that is supported
#    on the system, not the minimum version!
#  PythonInterp_MUST_BE_FOUND - If set to TRUE, then the python executable
#    must be found or the CMake configure will stop immediately.
#
