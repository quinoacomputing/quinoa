Included in this directory is a snapshot of the GPL Perl script cloc.pl.  This
is a source code line counting tool.  Also contained in this directory are the
files cloc.<LANGUAGE_TYPE>.in that defines specializations of the default cloc
langauge definitions for TriBITS software.  Adding a language definition file
directly to TriBITS aids in trying to help standardize the names of language
files a little.

To run the tool on your project, do:

   $ cd SOME_PROJECT
   $ $TRIBITS_DIR/common_tools/cloc/cloc.pl \
        --read-lang-def=<LANG_DEF_FILE> \
        .

Here, the different language definition files are:

   $TRIBITS_DIR/common_tools/cloc/cloc.core-languages.in
   $TRIBITS_DIR/common_tools/cloc/cloc.script-languages.in

Different TriBITS projects can copy these langauge definition files and define
their own language standards.  However, for the purposes of TriBITS meta build
across projects, it would be beneficial if all TriBITS projects could use a
single standard for language file extensions.

This will print statisitics to the screen.  See cloc.pl --help for other
useful option.
