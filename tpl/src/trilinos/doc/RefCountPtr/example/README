This directory contains working C++ code for the example programs
described in the RefCountPtr beginner's guide.  To build these
programs using g++ one just needs to set the environment variable
TRILINOS_BUILD to the base build directory containing a configured
version of the package Teuchos.

After setting the environment variable TRILINOS_BUILD, the
example programs can be built as:

  make -f classicMakefile all

One can build only the original example program that uses raw C++
pointers (and contains memory deallocation errors) as:

  make -f classicMakefile example_raw_cpp_pointers.exe

One can also build only the refactored example program that uses
RefCountPtr<> smart pointers (which should be free of any memory
deallocation problems) as:

  make -f classicMakefile example_ref_count_ptr.exe
