<dl>
<dt>1.09 - Mar 6, 2016 </dt>
<dd><ul>
<li> add #define R123_USE_U01_DOUBLE to u10fixedpt.h
<li> fix definition of const char *srcstr[] in util_opencl.h
<li> improve nvccfeatures.h so that 64-bit philox can be used
both on the host and on the cuda device.
<li> add _Pragmas so R123_STATIC_ASSERT doesn't warn with clang-3.6.
<li> boxmuller.hpp doesn't look for sincos when __APPLE__ is true.
</ul></dd>
<dt>1.08 - Aug 20, 2013 </dt>
<dd><ul>
<li> Fix a bug in threefry2xW whereby rotation constants were
chosen incorrectly after the 20th round.  There is no reason to
suspect that the incorrectly chosen rotation constants were "bad"
or "deficient" so there is no reason to suspect the quality of the
random numbers produced.  Using threefry with R>20 would have been
rare in any case.  The fix simply makes the implementation correspond 
correctly to the description in the paper.
<li> Add examples/uniform.hpp, examples/boxmuller.hpp and
     examples/ua.hpp, containing example code to generate uniformly
     and gaussian distributed floats and doubles.  Also add unit tests
     (ut_uniform.cpp, ut_uniform_IEEEkat.cpp) and timing harnesses
     (time_boxmuller.cpp and time_boxmuller_cuda.cpp).
<li> Demote u01.h from the include/Random123/ to examples/ufixed01.h, but
     examples/uniform.hpp is preferred.
<li> Add kat_vectors for threefry2xW_32 and threefry4xW_72, i.e., the
largest number of supported rounds in each case.
<li> Mention ukey on the first page of docs.
<li> Fix typos in documentation and comments and in gccfeatures.h.
<li> Don't #include <x86intrin.h> unless (defined(__x86_64__)||defined(__i386__)).
<li> Use __clang__ rather than __llvm__ in the predicate that decides whether to
     include clangfeatures.h.
<li> Add support for Portland Group compilers.
<li> Add support for gcc and IBM XL compilers on powerpc64, e.g. BlueGene/Q.
<li> Refuse to build with CUDA before 4.1 to avoid namespace bug.
</ul></dd>

<dt>1.07 - Nov 7, 2012 </dt>
<dd><ul>
<li> Provide const static data members:  _Min and _Max in Engine and MicroURNG, which
work around a non-standard requirement imposed by the MacOS Xcode 4.5.2 &lt;random&gt; library.
<li> Fine-grained test macros for specific features of C++11 rather than
an all-or-none USE_CXX0X macro.  Features tested:
constexpr, unrestricted unions, explicit conversions, &lt;random&gt; and &lt;type_traits&gt;.
<li> Declare max() and min() methods with the R123_CONSTEXPR attribute
in Engine and MicroURNG.
<li> Improved clang support
<li> Works with Solaris Sun CC now (requires -library=stlport4)
<li> NVIDIA GTX6x0 should report correct core count
<li> ut_features prints the list of features that compile on the build platform
<li> Compiles cleanly with -Wall -Wextra (implying -Wunused-parameter -Wsign-compare)
</ul></dd>

<dt>1.06 - Apr 5, 2012 </dt>
<dd><ul>
<li> Added a known answer test for the u01 functions (kat_u01).
<li> Defend headers against possible max and min macros in "system" header files.
</ul></dd>

<dt>1.05 - Mar 20, 2012 </dt><dd>
<ul><li>
MicroURNG and GSL_MICROURNG no longer give the programmer control
over the number bits in the internal counter via a template or macro argument.
Such flexibility is too easy to misuse, with the possible consequence
of repeating random values.  Now, all MicroURNGs have a period in
excess of 2^32, and MicroURNG&lt;CBRNG&gt;(c1, k1)
and MicroURNG&lt;CBRNG&gt;(c2, k2) "collide" if and only if c1==c2 and k1==k2.</li>
<li>Added &lt;Random123/u01.h&gt; header file with static functions for conversion
of integers to uniformly distributed floating point values.</li>
<li>Make operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp;, const r123array&amp;) and operator&gt;&gt;(ostream&amp;, r123array&amp;)
inline.  This should work around ODR violations when the header files are
included in more than one file in a project.</li>
<li>Recognize that icpc has an _mm_set_epi64x intrinsic as of version 12.1.</li>
<li>The gsl adapters always return 32-bits of random data, regardless of the
width of counter type.</li>
<li>Works around lack of anonymous enums in Intel OpenCL 1.5</li>
<li>gencl.sh works on MacOS and systems with "classic" BSD indent.</li>
<li>Tests run on AMD Radeon 7970 (Tahiti).</li>
</ul>

</dd>

<dt>1.04 - Dec 5, 2011</dt><dd>
<ul><li>
new kat_vectors - there are now three tests for each tested generator: gen(ctr=0, key=0), gen(ctr=fff, key=0xfff),
    and gen(ctr=digits-of-pi, key=more-digits-of-pi).  There are fewer tests overall, but they provide
    better coverage, especially of non-zero keys.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>1.03 - Nov 30, 2011</dt><dd>
<ul>
<li> overhaul known answer tests (kat)
   <ul>
   <li> common source for serial C, C++, cuda and opencl replaces katc and katpp </li>
   <li> add missing kat_vectors for threefry2x32 </li>
   </ul></li>
<li> make keyinit functions device/kernel functions in CUDA/OpenCL </li>
<li> replace r123array::assemble methods with r123array::seed(SeedSeq) template </li>
<li> cleanup of signatures of Engine and MicroURNG methods: 
   <ul>
      <li> Engine(ukey_type&amp;) and MicroURNG(ctr_type, ukey_type) constructors.</li>
      <li> Engine(SeedSeq&amp;) takes a reference argument, and, when C++0x &lt;type_traits&gt;
           are available the SeedSeq templates don't participate in "surprising" overloads. </li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>1.02 - Nov 21, 2011</dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>
<b> BUG FIXED </b> in threefry2xW_R(R&lt;20, ...).  Earlier implementations of
threefry2x32_R and threfry2x64_R produced incorrect
results when called with the number of rounds less than 20.
The bug caused extra work to be done in every call, possibly resulting in <i>more</i>
mixing than the correct implementation delivers.  Both old (buggy, more mixing) and new (bug-fixed, less mixing)
implementations have been rechecked and are fully "Crush-Resistant". </li>
<li>worked around problems with argument marshalling in version 2.4 of the AMDAPPSDK OpenCL implementation</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>1.01 - Nov 11, 2011</dt><dd>
<ul>
<li>allow the user to define __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS</li>
<li>allow r123arrayNxW::incr(larger_than_largest_value_type)</li>
</ul>

<dt>1.00 - Sep 26, 2011</dt><dd>Initial release</dd>
