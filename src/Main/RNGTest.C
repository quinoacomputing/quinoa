//! Global-scope data. Initialized by the main chare and distibuted to all PEs by
//! the Charm++ runtime system. Though semantically not const, all these global
//! data should be considered read-only. See also http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/
//! manuals/html/charm++/manual.html. The data below is global-scope because they
//! must be available to all PEs which could be on different machines. In a
//! previous non-Charm++ design, most of this data was held at class-level, but
//! since the generators in g_rng must be possible to be called from
//! global-scope, as external generators to TestU01, it is easier to make g_rng
//! global-scope, as well the additional data required to initialize it,
//! contained in g_inputdeck (storing all parsed user input).  This is required
//! for serializing during migration of g_rng across the network.
//!
//! Note that the container (std::map) holding tk::RNG objects uses value
//! semantics which is safer and generally less error-prone than reference
//! semantics. At the same time tk::RNG is used in a polymorphic fashion with
//! various classes that adhere to the concepts required by Concept defined
//! inside tk::RNG. tk::RNG does not define a default, i.e., non-templated
//! constructor, since then the "derived" class object could not be initialized
//! rendering the class tk::RNG empty-constructed, which invites abuse and
//! ill-defined behavior. As such, the "derived" class type comes through the
//! constructors and thus would not be available for a pack/unpack migrator
//! required by Charm++ from within. Templating the class tk::RNG is not an
//! option since then we could not hold tk::RNG objects in a simple std::vector.
//! As a result of the above requirements, the tk::RNG objects in g_rng are
//! migrated (here in global-scope) by reinstantiating RNGStack, which
//! reinstatiates the RNG factory, from which the RNGs selected by the user are
//! instantiated.
//!
//! Note also that RNGFactory associates tk::ctr::RNG ids (enum class values) to
//! function pointers (std::function objects pointing to tk::RNG constructors
//! bound with their arguments). Since function pointers cannot simply be
//! serialized and migrated via the network, they must also be recreated on
//! remote machines. This initial migration of global-scope data is done by the
//! Charm++ runtime once the main chare constructor is finished -- see the
//! RNGTestDriver constructor, which initializes the data required for the
//! migration).

  public:
    //! \brief Constructor
    //! \details The main chare constructor is the main entry point of the
    //!   program, called by the Charm++ runtime system. The constructor does
    //!   basic initialization steps, e.g., parser the command-line, prints out
    //!   some useful information to screen (in verbose mode), and instantiates
    //!   a driver. Since Charm++ is fully asynchronous, the constructor
    //!   usually spawns asynchronous objects and immediately exits. Thus in the
    //!   body of the main chare constructor we fire up an 'execute' chare,
    //!   which then calls back to Main::execute(). Finishing the main chare
    //!   constructor the Charm++ runtime system then starts the
    //!   network-migration of all global-scope data (if any). The execute chare
    //!   calling back to Main::execute() signals the end of the migration of
    //!   the global-scope data. Then we are ready to execute the driver. Since
    //!   the random number generator test suite is parallel and asynchronous,
    //!   its driver fires up additional Charm++ chare objects which then call
    //!   back to Main::finalize() at some point in the future when all work has
    //!   been finished. finalize() then exits by calling Charm++'s CkExit(),
    //!   shutting down the runtime system.
