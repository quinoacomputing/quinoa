//! Pack/Unpack selected partial differential equations. This Pack/Unpack method
//! (re-)creates the PDE factory since it needs to (re-)bind function
//! pointers on different processing elements. Therefore we circumvent Charm's
//! usual pack/unpack for this type, and thus sizing does not make sense: sizing
//! is a no-op. We could initialize the factory in InciterDriver's constructor
//! and let this function re-create the stack only when unpacking, but that
//! leads to repeating the same code twice: once in InciterDriver's constructor,
//! once here. Another option is to use this pack/unpack routine to both
//! initially create (when packing) and to re-create (when unpacking) the
//! factory, which eliminates the need for pre-creating the object in
//! InciterDriver's constructor and therefore eliminates the repeated code. This
//! explains the guard for sizing: the code below is called for packing only (in
//! serial) and packing and unpacking (in parallel).

//! \brief Charm++ main chare for the shock hydroddynamics executable, inciter.
//! \details In inciter the Charm++ runtime system is initialized only after the
//!   mesh has been read in, partitioned, and the necessary data structures,
//!   e.g., communication maps, have been generated. This delayed initialization
//!   of the Charm++ runtime system is required since the mesh partitioning is
//!   done by Zoltan, an MPI library. Note that this Charm++ main chare object
//!   should not be in a namespace.

    //! \brief Constructor
    //! \details The main chare constructor is the main entry point of the
    //!   Charm++ portion of inciter, called by the Charm++ runtime system. The
    //!   constructor does basic initialization steps, prints out some useful
    //!   information to screen (in verbose mode), and instantiates a driver.
    //!   Since Charm++ is fully asynchronous, the constructor usually spawns
    //!   asynchronous objects and immediately exits. Thus in the body of the
    //!   main chare constructor we fire up an 'execute' chare, which then calls
    //!   back to Main::execute(). Finishing the main chare constructor the
    //!   Charm++ runtime system then starts the network-migration of all
    //!   global-scope data (if any). The execute chare calling back to
    //!   Main::execute() signals the end of the migration of the global-scope
    //!   data. Then we are ready to execute the driver. Since inciter is
    //!   parallel and asynchronous, its driver fires up additional Charm++
    //!   chare objects which then call back to Main::finalize() at some point
    //!   in the future when all work has been finished. finalize() then exits
    //!   by calling Charm++'s CkExit(), shutting down the runtime system.
    //! \see http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/charm++/manual.html
