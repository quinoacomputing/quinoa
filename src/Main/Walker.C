//! \details Note that this object should not be in a namespace.
class Main : public CBase_Main {

  public:
    //! \brief Constructor
    //! \details The main chare constructor is the main entry point of the
    //!   program, called by the Charm++ runtime system. The constructor does
    //!   basic initialization steps, e.g., parser the command-line, prints out
    //!   some useful information to screen (in verbose mode), and instantiates
    //!   a driver. Since Charm++ is fully asynchronous, the constructor
    //!   usually spawns asynchronous objects and immediately exits. Thus in the
    //!   body of the main chare constructor we fire up an 'execute' chare,
    //!   which then calls back to Main::execute(). Finishing the main chare
    //!   constructor the Charm++ runtime system then starts the
    //!   network-migration of all global-scope data (if any). The execute chare
    //!   calling back to Main::execute() signals the end of the migration of
    //!   the global-scope data. Then we are ready to execute the driver. Since
    //!   the random walker is parallel and asynchronous, its driver fires up
    //!   additional Charm++ chare objects which then call back to
    //!   Main::finalize() at some point in the future when all work has been
    //!   finished. finalize() then exits by calling Charm++'s CkExit(),
    //!   shutting down the runtime system.
