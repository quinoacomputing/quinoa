//!   e.g., communication maps, have been generated. This delayed initialization
//!   of the Charm++ runtime system is required since the mesh partitioning is

  public:
    //! \brief Constructor
    //! \details Inciter's main chare constructor is the entry point of the
    //!   Charm++ portion of inciter, called by the Charm++ runtime system. The
    //!   constructor does basic initialization steps, prints out some useful
    //!   information to screen (in verbose mode), and instantiates a driver.
    //!   Since Charm++ is fully asynchronous, the constructor usually spawns
    //!   asynchronous objects and immediately exits. Thus in the body of the
    //!   main chare constructor we fire up an 'execute' chare, which then calls
    //!   back to Main::execute(). Finishing the main chare constructor the
    //!   Charm++ runtime system then starts the network-migration of all
    //!   global-scope data (if any). The execute chare calling back to
    //!   Main::execute() signals the end of the migration of the global-scope
    //!   data. Then we are ready to execute the driver. Since inciter is
    //!   parallel and asynchronous, its driver fires up additional Charm++
    //!   chare objects which then call back to Main::finalize() at some point
    //!   in the future when all work has been finished. finalize() then exits
    //!   by calling Charm++'s CkExit(), shutting down the runtime system.
    //! \see http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/charm++/manual.html
