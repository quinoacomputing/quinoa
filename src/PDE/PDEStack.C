  \brief     Stack of partial differential equations
  \details   This file defines class PDEStack, which implements various
    functionality related to registering and instantiating partial differential
    equation types. Registration and instantiation use a partial differential
    equation factory, which is a std::map (an associative container),
    associating unique partial differential equation keys to their constructor
    calls. For more details, see the in-code documentation of the constructor.

//  Constructor: register all partial differential equations into factory
//! \details This constructor consists of several blocks, each registering a
//!   potentially large number of entries in a partial differential equation
//!   factory, a standard associative container. At this time, each type of
//!   partial differential equation can be configured to use a unique _physics
//!   policy_ and a unique _problem policy_. (More types of policies might be
//!   introduced in the future.) Policy classes are template arguments to the
//!   partial differential equation classes and influence their behavior in a
//!   different way, abstracting away certain functions, e.g., how to set
//!   problem-specific initial and/or boundary conditions and how to update
//!   their coefficients during time integration. For more information on
//!   policy-based design, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy-based_design.
//!   This abstraction allows [separation of concerns]
//!   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns).
//!
//!   Since the functionality of the policies are orthogonal to each other,
//!   i.e., they do not depend on each other or their host (the partial
//!   differential equation class), a Cartesian product of combinations are
//!   possible, depending on which policies are selected. _This constructor
//!   registers all possible combinations of policies for all available
//!   differential equations._ By _register_, we mean, an entry is recorded in
//!   an associative container, a std::map, that associates a lightweight key of
//!   type inciter::ctr::PDEKey, consisting of only an enum for each policy
//!   type, to an std::function object that holds the constructor bound to its
//!   arguments corresponding to a particular partial differential equation +
//!   policies combination. Note that registering these entries in the map does
//!   not invoke the constructors. The mapped value simply stores how the
//!   constructors should be invoked at a later time. At some point later,
//!   based on user input, we then instantiate only the partial differential
//!   equations (and only those configurations) that are requested by the user.
//!
//!   Since all partial differential equation types (registered in the factory)
//!   "inherit" from a common "base", client-code is unform and generic, and
//!   thus immune to changes in the inner workings of the particular partial
//!   differential equations as long as they fullfill certain concepts, i.e.,
//!   implement certain member functinos, enforced by the _common base_, PDE.
//!   The words "inherit and "base" are quoted here, because the common base
//!   does not use inheritance in the normal OOP sense and does not use
//!   reference semantics, i.e., pointers, visible to client-code either. The
//!   relationship is more of a _models a_-type, which simplifies client-code
//!   and allows for the benfits of runtime inheritance with value-semantics
//!   which is less error prone and easier to read. See more about the
//!   _models-a_ relationship and its implementation in, e.g., PDE/CGPDE.h.
//!
//!   The design discussed above allows the registration, instantiation, and
//!   use of the partial differential equations to be generic, which eliminates
//!   a lot of boiler-plate code and makes client-code uniform.
//!
//!   _Details of registration using brigand::for_each and
//!   tk::cartesian_product:_
//!
//!   The template argument to brigand::for_each, as used below, requires a
//!   list of list of types. We use brigand::list of brigand::list of types,
//!   listing all possible policies, where the inner list must have exactly two
//!   types, as the list of lists is constructed from two lists using the
//!   cartesian product, and the length of the outer list (the list of lists) is
//!   arbitrary. The constructor argument to brigand::for_each is a functor that
//!   is to be applied to all members of the outer list. tk::cartesian_product
//!   will create all possible combinations of these types and call the functor
//!   with each type of the created sequence as a template parameter. The
//!   functor here inherits from registerPDE, which, i.e., its constructor call,
//!   needs a single template argument, a class templated on policy classes.
//!   This is the partial differential equation class to be configured by
//!   selecting policies and to be registered. The arguments to registerPDE's
//!   constructor are the factory, the enum denoting the differential equation
//!   type, and a reference to a variable of type std::set< ctr::PDEType >,
//!   which is only used internally to PDEStack for counting up the number of
//!   unique differential equation types registered, used for diagnostics
//!   purposes.
